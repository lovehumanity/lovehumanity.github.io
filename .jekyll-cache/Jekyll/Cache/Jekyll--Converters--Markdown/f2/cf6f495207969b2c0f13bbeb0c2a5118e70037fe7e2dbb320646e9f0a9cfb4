<p>In this short post I will lay out some things you can do to remove ads from your life. This post is in no way definitive and only a few ways will be explored. I am very much against ads hence why Iâ€™m making this post.</p>

<h2 id="install-an-ad-blocker-in-your-browser">Install an ad-blocker in your browser</h2>

<p>This one is key because most ads nowadays are served on the web. Google Chrome and Firefox allow you to install ad blockers the one I recommend is Ublock-Origin by Raymond Hill which is free and open source meaning that you can read the source code yourself and change it if you doso desire</p>

<p>Chrome <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm">link</a></p>

<p>Firefox <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">link</a></p>

<p>This will remove the vast majority of the ads you see on the web including ads on youtube videos</p>

<h2 id="use-3rd-party-apps-on-your-phone">Use 3rd party apps on your phone</h2>

<p>You can consider downloading the alternative youtube app on android called newpipe which can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases/tag/v0.20.11">here</a></p>

<p>If you use Reddit you can also use the app â€˜slideâ€™ available on the <a href="https://f-droid.org/">f-droid</a> app store which will remove all the ads</p>

<h2 id="pausemute-tv-when-ads-are-playing">Pause/mute tv when ads are playing</h2>

<p>This one is common sense if you have tevo pause the tv until the ads finish if you donâ€™t have tevo mute the tv</p>
