I"¶<p>I realize that I can be incredibly foolish, silly, and ignorant sometimes My own sense of self-importance has let me down considerably and to think that I know better than others and God is foolish to think that way because God is in complete control of absolutely everything. People shouldnâ€™t think they are better than others because of their perceived spiritual blessings they have received as a result of their faith in God.</p>
