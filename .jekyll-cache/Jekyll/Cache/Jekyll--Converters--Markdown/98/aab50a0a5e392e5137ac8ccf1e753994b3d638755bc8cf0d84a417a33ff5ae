I"¶<p>In this short post I will talk a little about how when you canâ€™t do good because of some reason like a disagreement with yourself or a flaw you have that you should do good elsewhere. But if Iâ€™m being completely honest, you should aim to do good in your own home first before you go around trying to do good elsewhere â€“ you should seek to fix the issues in your own home before trying to fix issues in other peopleâ€™s home.</p>
