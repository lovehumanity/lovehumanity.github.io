I"”<p>I wanted to make this short post today on judging others and yourself. Iâ€™ve suffered immensely because of all the judging that I have given to myself, all the times I felt like Iâ€™m unworthy or inadequate because of all the judging that I have given to myself. Itâ€™s also caused me a lot of suffering thinking about how others will judge me or view me, and I guess itâ€™s mostly because of all the judging that I have given to myself and so I think that everyone else judges me the same way that I judge myself. But I realized that giving judgment to someone (including yourself) isnâ€™t correct because of all this suffering that judging inflicts.</p>
