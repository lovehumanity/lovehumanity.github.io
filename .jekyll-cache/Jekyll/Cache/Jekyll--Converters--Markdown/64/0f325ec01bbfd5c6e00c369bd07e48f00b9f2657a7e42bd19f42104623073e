I"d<p>The Law of Mutual Attraction is a univerisal law which quite simply means that like attracts like. A basic example is your own thoughts that you put out to the world you receive in return, so if you are having lots of negative thoughts, then the world will respond to that by attracting you to people of a similar nature in terms of people whom think like you, whereas if you are more positive, then the world will seem like a much brighter and better place. I feel we need more people in the world who are more optimistic about their circumstances and people whom are positive in nature and have good attitudes towards things because what you put out to the world - you receive in return.
