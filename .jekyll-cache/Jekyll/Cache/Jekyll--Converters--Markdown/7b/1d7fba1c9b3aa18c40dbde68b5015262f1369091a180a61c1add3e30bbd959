I"¸<p>There is a motive in every action taken.</p>

<p>A really good habit I have recently gotten into is assessing my motives for why I take actions by being more mindful of my actions. My actions are being assessed by myself always and so I understand myself a bit better, which allows me to be better.</p>

<p>People who are asleep so to speak just take actions as they see fit and donâ€™t ever evaluate why they take those actions. Therefore, they are not awake in a spiritual sense. Believe me if people got into the habit of assessing their motives for actions, the world would be a better place for us all as it would allow people to remove negative destructive habits.</p>

<p>I will end by saying that there is a motive for every action, and many donâ€™t assess their motives and so unconsciously have a lot of habits and behaviours which are unhealthy and detrimental to themselves or those around them. Of course, I still have some behaviours which Iâ€™m slowly but surely learning to get rid of, Iâ€™m far from perfect and so are many others in this world.</p>

<p>Bottom line: assess your motives behind your actions and then you can begin to change and be a better more developed individual.</p>
