I"¯<p>Recently I realized that I was praying and asking for too much and it was being given to me, but it was a bit off because it was too much of a good thing and there is such thing as praying for too many good things because the prayers that I sent out were essentially competing with one another when they should have been working with each other.</p>

<p>The solution I feel to not having too much of a good thing is only take that which you can handle. Donâ€™t feel you are letting others down in rejecting their good things they sent to you because you can have too much of a good thing.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s also about slowing down because with me being in dark for so long and suddenly being in the light I realized that like I was just having so many good things as a means of compensating for being in dark for so long.</p>

<p>My general advice would be to realize when you are having too much of a good thing and so slow down when you feel your having too much of a good thing and also to not be greedy in the good things that you have, but express gratitude for all the good things that are coming your way and the good things that you already have.</p>

<p>I know that Iâ€™ve put a lot of posts on my blog,, but the reason I put these all in a massive batch like this is due to me being in a mental hospital and having a lot more time to better understand myself and thereby make considerable progress towards God.</p>

<p>Also, itâ€™s about taking your time and donâ€™t feel you need to rush because of others, because when you rush the whole world rushes because you make up the world. So take your time and remember that the journey is a marathon not a sprint so enjoy each and every moment of it.</p>
