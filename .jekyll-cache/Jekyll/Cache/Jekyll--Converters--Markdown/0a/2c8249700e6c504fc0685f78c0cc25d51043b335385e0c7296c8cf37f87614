I"Ò<p>In this short post I will talk a little about how when you canâ€™t do good because of some reason like a disagreement with yourself or a flaw you have that you should do good elsewhere. But if Iâ€™m being completely honest, you should aim to do good in your own home first before you go around trying to do good elsewhere â€“ you should seek to fix the issues in your own home before trying to fix issues in other peopleâ€™s home.</p>

<p>Firstly, Iâ€™ve suffered a lot and that suffering has really made me into the person that I am today, but I put efforts to see the good in what that suffering has brought to the world.</p>

<p>I also realized that I sometimes canâ€™t do good in the world because I can be selfish sometimes, but in such times, I realized that I compensate that by doing good someplace else, which isnâ€™t a bad thing at all. But deters me from actually changing myself when I do this because I think its ok for me to â€˜give upâ€™ when I have done good elsewhere in the world. But it doesnâ€™t make it alright.</p>

<p>I also realized that this is a really good principal to live by that if you canâ€™t do good in your own home, seek to do good elsewhere in the world because you are not the only person in the world and itâ€™s important that you stay true to yourself and your own beliefs in things.</p>

<p>But I just wanted to add that you should have good intentions when following this simple principal. By good intentions I mean serving God, helping others etc.</p>

<p>The good that you can seek to do is endless, offer your service as a volunteer in some way, donate some money to charity, give your money to a friend in need, phone a friend you havenâ€™t spoken to in some time. Point being is that when you canâ€™t do good in your own home for some reason, seek to do good elsewhere in the world because it will be the world a much better place for everyone.</p>

<p>But you should also strive for balance in what you put out to the world and donâ€™t take things to extremes and seek to recognize when enough giving is enough. Feel free to also read my article on <a href="https://lovehumanity.gitlab.io/spiritual/Giving-To-Others/">Giving</a> which explains why its of vital importance that everyone gives to others.</p>
