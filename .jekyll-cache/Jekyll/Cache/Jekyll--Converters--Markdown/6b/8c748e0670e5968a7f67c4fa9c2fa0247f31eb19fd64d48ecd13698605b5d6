I"Ú<p>You should first start by recognizing that its not all about you and allowing things like pride and arrogance (ego) have an impact on your ability to give. I myself have allowed pride to affect me a lot and its cost me a lot in life as it has others.</p>

<p>Everyone has the ability to give and its important that others give because as the Master Jesus once said you ‚Äòreap what you sow‚Äô, therefore what you put out to the world you will also get in return, but only if you believe that God will return what you give and you shouldn‚Äôt worry too much about when you God will return what you give because so long as you have enough faith that God will give what you put out ‚Äì he will.</p>

<p>A basic example is when you pray for others with the intent of helping them, then God will see that and will return that and help you in some way. But it all comes down to right intention (working for the good of others) in Buddhism which is something I have struggled with a lot in my life.</p>

<p>There was also a really good video on YouTube that said that giving to others will make you a lot happier and a lot more cheerful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78nsxRxbf4w">Ted Talk</a></p>

<p>This is information which I got from The Great White Brotherhood‚Äôs book ‚ÄúLinking with the 4th dimension‚Äù Chapter 27 The Giving Plane, you can find a link to the book here <a href="https://thegreatwhitebrotherhood.org/books/">Linking with the 4th Dimension</a> and I have found it to be true in my life.</p>
