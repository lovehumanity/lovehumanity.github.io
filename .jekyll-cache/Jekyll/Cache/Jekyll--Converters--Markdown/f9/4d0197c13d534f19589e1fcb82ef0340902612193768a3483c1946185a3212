I"õ<p>I realized that one thing that is holding me back a lot now that I am starting to see some results with my spiritual advances, I feel the need to rush spirituality for more gains because I have been in the dark for so long now and given way to a lot of negative thoughts and been quite depressed and just felt so lost. But now that I am starting to see some results with spirituality, I am willing to learn lot about myself a lot more because I can see that there are indeed significant gains.</p>
