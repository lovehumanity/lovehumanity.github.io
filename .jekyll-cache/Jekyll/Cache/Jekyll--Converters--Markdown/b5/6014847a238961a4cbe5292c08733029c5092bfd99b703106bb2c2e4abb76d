I"´<p>Sometimes I take things to extremes and it has caused me and others a lot of suffering.</p>

<p>I guess the reason I do that is because I desire something and donâ€™t yet fully appreciate that all desire and wants will inevitably lead to suffering and itâ€™s as the saying goes you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink.</p>

<p>I also wrongly have this belief that I need to please others and be a good person all the time, which is just wrong because I donâ€™t need to be a good person if I chose not to be and this doesnâ€™t make me a bad person, because what makes a good person? Itâ€™s relative what makes a good person and should be your own interpretation of what it means to be a good person.</p>

<p>But you shouldnâ€™t take it in extremes because it can be too much of a good thing which is a form of evil, itâ€™s also about desire because you desire to be a good person and this leads to suffering.</p>

<p>The solution is of course to strive for balance in things and never take things too personally and never take things to extremes because you can commit sins in taking things to extremes i.e thou shall not kill and its just also unfair on the rest of the world.</p>
