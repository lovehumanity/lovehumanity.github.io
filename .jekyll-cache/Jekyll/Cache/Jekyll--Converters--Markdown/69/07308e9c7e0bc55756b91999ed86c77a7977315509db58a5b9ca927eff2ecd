I"Å<p>I thought I would write this article on compassion. This will be similar to my article I wrote on self-compassion, but it applies to giving others compassion and compassion is a very important thing to give to others because a lot of people have gone through suffering and its important to be understanding of that suffering and so give them the compassion that will heal them.</p>
