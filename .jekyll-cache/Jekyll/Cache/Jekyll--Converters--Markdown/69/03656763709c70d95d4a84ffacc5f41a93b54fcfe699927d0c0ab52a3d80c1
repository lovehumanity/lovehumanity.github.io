I"ÿ<p>Self-Worth is something I have struggled with my entire life, I guess itâ€™s like somewhat due to my personality flaws and how due to these flawsâ€™ others donâ€™t accept me as much because I kind of like think itâ€™s right to put myself down in some way because of lack of acceptance of who I really am. Which I think equates to holiness in some way, but I realize itâ€™s incredibly stupid and unfair on others and the rest of the world but itâ€™s also important in the fact that you put yourself down.</p>
