I"\<p>I realized that one thing that has caused me suffering, and many others suffering is patronization which is whereby you think that you are better than others and so in very subtle ways have behaviours which condescend them in some way. But it’s also about thinking that you can get the better of others in some way and you think that you are more intelligent than others which is quite arrogant because we are all equal and to patronize another isn’t in line with reality because you are not better or lesser than anyone or anything else. Everyone and everything are equal in the eyes of God.</p>
