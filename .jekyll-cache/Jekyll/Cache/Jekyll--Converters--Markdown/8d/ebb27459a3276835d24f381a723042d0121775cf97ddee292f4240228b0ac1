I":<p>Praying is one of the things that I think a lot of people can benefit from. The secret with prayer is to have the genuine intention of helping the person/thing you are praying and doing it for them and not for yourself. To progress towards God, itâ€™s important to serve your fellow man, meditate and pray.</p>
