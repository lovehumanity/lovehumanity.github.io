I"D<p>I realized that one thing that holds me back a lot in my progress towards God is impressing others, which is a little different to virtue signalling in my eyes. When you feel you need to impress others you just become a slave to other people’s opinions of you and don’t become who you want to be. I realized also that I somewhat don’t respect my own spiritual advances and so somewhat try to impress others with the decisions I take. But I wouldn’t say I outright try to use my advanced level of spirituality to impress others that much, but it’s just sometimes.</p>
