I"!<p>I wanted to make this short post about thoughts and the importance of them and the importance of not giving way to unhappiness in your life and pushing happiness as best as you can. For the past few months, I’ve been engaging in a lot of negative thought patterns about life in general. I realized that the reason I have such thoughts is because its my response to when things don’t go my way, I have these negative thoughts as a means of ‘protest’, which is extremely unhealthy. I’ve also felt so lost and one of the reasons why I think I’ve felt so lost is because I tried so hard to make myself unhappy and anytime, I would feel happy I would repress that feeling so that I could feel as unhappy and as miserable as possible. Which looking back I realized I was quite lost in doing this and if pressed to answer why I did it the closest thing I could come to is because I was angry and upset at the way I’ve been treated in life and so this was a means of protest against how I’ve been treated in life. Which is not very mature and has affected my vibration significantly.</p>

<p>The Buddha himself recognized the importance of thoughts saying “We are what we think. All that we are arises with our thoughts. With our thoughts we make the world”. It’s also one of the noble eightfold paths Right thought being the second part of the noble eightfold path which goes to show the significance that the Buddha put on having the right thoughts. I also like this quote “Your worst enemy can not harm you as much as your own thoughts, unguarded. But once mastered, no one can help you as much, not even your father or your mother.”</p>

<p>What it means to have right thought to me means that you reject thoughts that are in their nature negative and try to cultivate positive thoughts such as kindness to people, love for people etc. Personally, I would have a lot of thoughts which brought me unhappiness and misery. I engaged in these thoughts so much that I somewhat lost what it actually feels to be happy and when I’m ‘happy’ really, it’s just a feeling of satisfaction.</p>

<p>So, for me I am going to begin rejecting negative thoughts as best as I can and also rejecting unhappiness as best as I can. I’m also going to try and be as positive as I can about things. I hope that in time with this practice I can begin to become a much happier and spiritually awake person, because being unhappy and miserable doesn’t benefit anyone.</p>

<p>I realize I have a mountain to climb in terms of the negative, dark, dare I say evil thoughts that have been going through me and what I need to do to conquer such thoughts.  Also, the general feeling of unhappiness I’ve been pushing on to myself which has affected my vibration as have my thoughts. I feel it’s also made me weak minded or feeble in mind as I really can’t engage my mind as I used to as a result of all the unhappiness, I’ve been pushing onto myself. But as they say the journey of a thousand miles begins with one step and I like to think that this is a giant step in the correct direction to becoming an ‘ascended being’ which is something I aspire to.</p>

<p>But this has taught me whole affair I like to think has taught me a valuable lesson in the importance of not giving way to bad thoughts and also the importance of being happy and thereby rejecting unhappiness and misery, because it really has affected my motivation to do things in that because I have this general feeling of unhappiness I’m a lot less willing to do things because my view of the world has been affected negatively.</p>
