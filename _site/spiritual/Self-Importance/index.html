      <section class="page__content" itemprop="text">
        
        <p>I realize that I can be incredibly foolish, silly and ignorant sometimes My own sense of self-importance has let me down considerably and to think that I know better than others and God is foolish to think that way because God is in complete control of absolutely everything. People shouldn’t think they are better than others because of their perceived spiritual blessings they have received as a result of their faifth in God.</p>

<p>I’ve let myself and the world down considerably due to thinking that I’m more important than others which is wrong because everyone and everything is equal even God himself in the eyes of God.</p>

<p>I foolishly chose self-importance over others and I was too arrogant and blinded by ignorance and prideful to see what it was I was doing to myself. All those times I hurt and deceived people and lied to their faces when they said “are you ok”? And not being as honest as I should be to them and saying “yeam i’m fine” when I just wasn’t. But also not being true to myself and my own beliefs.</p>

<p>But my own self-importance got in the way significantly in terms of making real tangeable progress towards God and I have been a complete and utter fool towards myself and let others down which isn’t what I stand for. But I have let others down and more importantly I’ve let myself down and the life of progress towards God which I would like to lead.</p>

<p>I will continue to pray and meditate as best as I can each day to God in the hopes that I can change for the benefit of the human species and more importantly for the benefit of myself. Its wrong what I’ve done to myself and zeaoulsly evil to have done all the things that I’ve done to myself and to think I can get away with it is stupid and foolish and to think that others can’t see my own actions is fooling myself. Praying that I reduce my pride (which I have done now) and reduce my own sense of importance. But I feel the pace of spirtuality is far too fast and should slow down.</p>

<p>My own sense of self-importance isn’t who I want to be anymore in terms of how I identify with being very important. I should respect myself and others more to recognize that I have been given life and so should put efforts into doing God’s work and not the work of the devil/evil. I’m sorry towards myself for having done the things that I have done to myself.</p>

<p>I guess its also about how I was in darkness for so long and now I’m begginging to see the light considerably more I wandered why I was in darkness for so so long.</p>

<p>The work of God should be in creating beautfy, lifting people’s spirits especially people who are down, expressing christ like emotions to others and more importantly yourself, striving to be happy, striving to be joyful, giving to others especially because the power of giving is true in the sense that what you give to others you get in return in the sense that you reap what you sow, but you should give with the belief that God will return to you what you give to others, but you shouldn’t to so for yourself – you should do so with the intent of serving God. Practing self-love more and being more positive.</p>

<p>The reason I gave way to so much self-importance is due to me not recognizeing the oneness of all life and realizing that I’m not the only person in the world and its also incredibly selfish to not believe in the word of God.</p>
