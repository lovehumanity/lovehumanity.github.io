Also what you should understand is everyone has their own limits associated to them. My limits will almost certainly be different to your limits. But I feel like its important to be understanding of other people’s limits. Also you should identify things that trigger your limits so that you can better understand and recongise if/when something will push you to that limit. Also I stuggle with basic things in that my trigggers for my limits can be simple things which leads me to a lot of mental stuggle for things that would be easy to most people, which I suppose is actually a disability.
