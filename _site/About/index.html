      <h1 id="page-title" class="page__title">About</h1>
    
    <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>Generally I don’t like talking about myself because I was into privacy a lot in my late teens and young adult years even sharing photos of myself was a big jump for me on this blog, but my general interests right now are computers.</p>

<p>In school I was really into History, Business Studies, Maths, Computers, Chess, Programming, Sociology, English, Debate club. I was an introvert in school so didn’t really go out too much during my school years or my uni years for that mattar because I guess I was so afaid of what others would think of me and now I would like to make up for that lost time somewhat and be a lot more sociable which I am slowly but surely becoming.</p>

<p>I have suffered from mental health in my life and to those who do suffer from mental health or think they suffer from mental heatlh, don’t be afraid to ask for help, there is no shame in it and you are not a lesser man for asking for help because in our society we have this terrible view on what a man should and shouldn’t be and this has evolved into toxic masculinity - which are things which are detrimental to us which we think is being a man when it isn’t.</p>

<h2 id="about-this-blog">About this Blog</h2>

<p>This blog was declared Saint Christopher’s Blog on on the day I posted my article on being authentic and true to yourself on 08/03/22.</p>

<p>This is my blog which I use as a tool for my personal development and my own spiritual journey and to help others along the way in their journeys…</p>

<p>If you disagree with any of the articles or want to get in touch feel free to send me an email with your thoughts chrisisamazing@protonmail.com .This blog is hosted completely free using jeykll minimal mistakes theme and github/gitlab and I encourage all who read this blog to start their own for their own spiritual journey and their own development.</p>

<p>In this Blog You’ll find articles on the following topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wellbeing</li>
  <li>Spirituality</li>
  <li>Self-Improvement</li>
  <li>Buddhism</li>
  <li>Anything else I deem important enough to share with the world</li>
</ul>

<p>This blog is hosted on both gitlab and github as of 28/02/2022! The links are:</p>

<p><a href="https://lovehumanity.gitlab.io/">https://lovehumanity.gitlab.io/</a><br>
<a href="https://lovehumanity.github.io/">https://lovehumanity.github.io/</a></p>

<p>Please note that I push to my gitlab repo and then this clones to my github repo, hence why the dates on github may not be accurate (I also don’t know how to use git that well xD)</p>

<p>I have taken the deliberate action to not place any advertisements on this blog mainly because I think that it takes away from the value of the articles and are just distractions to the eyes.</p>

<p>I also do not ask for <strong>ANY</strong> donations to this blog or myself, but in the past I did have a donation page which has been removed from this blog.</p>

<p>Also a side note that the articles on this blog are not very long in length because I like to keep it quick and to the point and avoid ‘filler’ as much as possible, which is what I see a lot of articles I read do. Also wanted to add that just because an article is old - that doesn’t mean that its of less value, I update each article and each article will stand the test of time.</p>

<p>As a side note I do update this blog very regularly and so if you enjoy this content and would like to continue to come back here please do consider bookmarking this blog in your browser or saving the link. Or you have the option to subscribe with RSS if you still use that and you will find an icon for that at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>I also advertise my posts on reddit under the username /u/SufficientDistrict10</p>

<p>And also have a brand new reddit forum which I have created which you can find linked below</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintChristopher/">https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintChristopher/</a></p>

<h2 id="awesome-subjects-mag">Awesome Subjects <img class="emoji" title=":mag:" alt=":mag:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f50d.png" height="20" width="20">
</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Buddhism <em>(Desire is the cause of suffering)</em>
</li>
  <li>Psychology _(Teleology - All human behaviour stems from a goal) _</li>
  <li>Spirituality <em>(I can be better, therefore I will strive to be)</em>
</li>
  <li>Economics <em>(The fed be printing money for days!)</em>
</li>
  <li>Taoism <em>(“When you identify a flaw as a flaw, you no longer be with that flaw”)</em>
</li>
  <li>Computer Security <em>(The Hackers man! The hackers!)</em>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I find that all subjects are linked together. Really it comes down to how you define the information in a subject. For example, Buddhism a religion or philosophy whichever way you wish to view it links strongly with Psychology. Then that links with economics because of how people trade etc, etc. Point being is that all subjects are intertwined in some way.</p>

<p>This blog is hosted using gitlab pages and Jekyll using the <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/">Minimal Mistakes theme</a> which allows me to host this blog completely free. I chose gitlab to host this blog because gitlab is <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab">more open source</a> than github which is completely <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24254324/is-github-com-source-code-open-source">closed sourced</a>. Personally I find it quite ironic that a website that hosts so much open source code isn’t itself open source, it’s a bit like writing a book on the importance of giving to others, and yet turning a profit for said book.</p>
