&lt;p&gt;Note: That this article was changed on 14/03/22 to be much more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people will generally say that one person’s good is different to another person’s good - that good and evil are subjective. However, this isn’t accurate. Good are things that are constructive; things that build things. While evil are things that are destructive, things that unbuild things. Evil isn’t confined to just destroying others, it can be destructive behaviours to yourself, for example eating unhealthily. Equally constructive things are not limited to things you do for others, it’s also things you do for yourself, for example doing the work you need to do, so that you stop yourself from having to stress about it, eating healthier things such as fruit and vegetables (because when you eat healthy you feel better within your soul)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people because they don’t know what good and evil are, have negative, destructive habits and behaviours without any knowledge. You either work for the forces of chaos, or you work for the forces of construction. There is no in-between. As much as you can fool yourself into thinking that there is an in-between, there isn’t. Most people are asleep to this truth, and because of this by default they work for the forces of chaos without any realisation. Equally we shouldn’t look down upon those who are seduced by evil because they have a place in life as much as the people that work for good and people that choose evil have their own right to choose as do people that work for construction in this world, hence why its important that both groups order and chaos, don’t put any efforts to change either side because its disrespectful and shows that you don’t accept that they make up a part of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I ask people what they want the world to be in the future, I most often get answers that amount to a world where there is world peace. With the idea being that it is in other people’s control if the world will be peaceful in the future. Failing to realise that each person is a part of the world. As Gandhi once said, “Be the change you wish to see in the world”. If you are a peaceful, loving person then this encourages others to be more peaceful and loving, if you are unkind, arrogant, and selfish then this encourages others to be unkind, arrogant and selfish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I will say that in the world as of right now there is a heavy sway for people to work for the forces of evil through their jobs, their family environment, their social positions and evil is a part of life and we as a species should accept that people have a right to choose evil over good and we shouldn’t judge those who do and have chosen evil over good. But we should be true to ourselves, regardlness of if we are drawn to construction or deconstruction (good or evil) and like I said we shouldn’t try too hard to change people who work for the forces of construction or deconstruction, but should only try to help them if they see that the path they are on isn’t who they really are. But my advice would be to be more accepting that there are good and bad people in the world and that people, even good people like myself do bad things from time to time and we shouldn’t condem those actions out of hand, but seek to understand and forgive those who do commit sins to us and put efforts to turning the other cheek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, its ok to work for a boss who is evil and you shouldn’t think yourself better than him/her for not being evil like him/her and for not committing the same level of sins as them. But seek to be true to yourself would be my honest advice here in this article, but recognize that there are people who are very evil in the world and seek to recognize that there are people that are very good in the world. In life we have extremes on both ends. But just accept that this is apart of life and you will become a lot happier inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the forces of good and evil are very real in this world that we live in, but just seek to be true to yourself regardless of if you do what could be construed as evil because like I said in my article that I wrote on evil - its a very seductive power and you need to be in my view an advanced being to be able to resist the power of evil, but you need to understand why its wrong and that only comes through experience and isn’t something that you can do in a single day. Also don’t not make the mistake of underestimating how much you understand yourself. Don’t be arrogant. Analyse your motives behind your actions and behaviours and do this regularly. Seek to better understand yourself. If you don’t put the time and effort into understanding yourself no one will, but be true to yourself regardless of what others tell you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saint Christopher's Blog</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">Note: That this article was changed on 14/03/22 to be much more accurate.

&lt;p&gt;In this article I will write a little on selfishness, this is something which I have given away to so much in my life and I thought that hiding my own selfishness and disguising it under the guide of selfless acts was the correct thing to do – it was not. Sincerity of purpose is what in my eyes counts the most in this world, but also being true to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I’ve been selfish because I can be cowardly at times and I’m not afraid to admit it, because I lack courage and have lacked courage my entire life, but this is something which I am working on as I write this article. Its also because I am just scared, afraid of what others may or may not think of me – or part of me is. But oft times I put on a face, a face that I am strong when really I just hide the fact that I mask inside the fact that I’m just lonely and lack friendship in my life, because I’ve been an introvert a lot of my life, that’s not to say that I’ve lacked friends completely – I just haven’t had close friends, friends I can really trust and rely upon and who I am loyal to and friends who are loyal to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, as a result of me being a coward I hide the way of the world from myself, and the way of the world could always be improved no matter how good things appear to look. I also choose to hide things from myself because there has been a lack of courage my entire life, but like I said I am working on this and it’s a positive that I am recognizing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I also don’t fully appreciate that choosing to not be scared/frightened at the appropriate times is extremely selfish because these granted negative emotions are there for a reason and they help us in life, because I delude myself in the sense that because I repress these negative emotions I don’t see the way of the world clearly, in the sense that there are very bad people in the world because I am a coward or part of me is and its both foolish to not respect the fact that there are very bad people in the world and its extremely selfish on the rest of the world do not respect that simple fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that my own pride, arrogance, and ignorance gets in the way a lot in regard to giving way to selfishness – as it does to many others in the world. But the only thing that can reduce things like pride, arrogance and ignorance is things like meditation, prayer, devotion to God, service to God etc. I guess I really need to reduce my own pride which has cost me and others a lot, but I intend to put right all those wrongs that I have caused to the world and especially to myself, by my own actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sad part about it is – is that I don’t actually quite realize most of my life when selfishness was playing a role but chose to hide it from myself a lot of the time because I didn’t want others to see me as a coward/frightened/scared, because I cared too much about what others think of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I should accept that these emotions are a normal part of life and are there to protect us in our lives which are a positive thing. But equally you should take the approach of 50/50. In the sense that you should hold a balance between both negative emotions and positive emotions and not take things to extremes which is something that I have done, which just wasn’t fair on myself or the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted this is still a work in progress for me in terms of reducing my own selfishness.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saint Christopher's Blog</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Why You Should Read</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/why-you-should-read/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why You Should Read" /><published>2022-03-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-03-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Why-You-Should-Read</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/why-you-should-read/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/blogs/reading/reading.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Reading&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article I will be talking about reading and why its so important for all to read this article to take up reading and have it be a part of your daily routine. Now reading doesn’t necessarily need to just be books that your read – it can also be reading about research papers in your relevant field, it can be reading articles, it can be reading blogs as you are doing right now – it isn’t only books that I encourage you to read, its any content that will bring value to you in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so inspired by the film Good Will Hunting and in the film the main character Will who was played by Matt Damon reads a considerable amount of books in his free time and there was one scene in particular which really did inspire me and that was when he was in the therapists room and he saw all the books on the shelves and he said that he read all the books on the shelves as if it was nothing to him. This amazed me and really encouraged me and inspired me to take up reading and have that be apart of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons why you should take up reading is because it allows you to become a more knowledgeable and sophisticated person and allows you to develop your vocabulary and allows you to know more about the world (especially if you are reading good books). But you should only read because you want to read – don’t read just because I say it here in this article, read because you want to read and only read the content that you feel drawn to and content that you are interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading also in my view allows you to become a lot better and a lot more developed person because it allows you to have a much clearer picture on the world, especially if you are reading the correct content – I can not emphasis this enough, because why should you read a book from someone who has 1 year experience in x subject when you can read a book written by someone who has 30 years of experience and has worked at multiple different companies? Point being is you should be selective of the content that you consume and only consume content which is of high value from people who know what they are talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another short point I just wanted to add here is that I believe that you shouldn’t read the news too often because the news has just become so heavily politicized especially with the virus always on the news and being spoken about. It just isn’t healthy for your mental health to constantly be watching the news every single day because bad news sells a lot more than good news and also how much value does the news really bring you in your life? Can you recall 5 articles that you read over the past month? I wager that most will say that they are not able to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, only take up reading because you want to take up reading and become the best version of yourself and only consume content which you feel drawn to and content which is of high value objectively speaking from people who are good writers/experts in their fields etc, because it will allow you to in one book read from an expert and this is of more value in my eyes than reading 100 books from people with very little experience in a subject. You also shouldn’t read content just because they are the most popular – granted most popular does mean something, but you should read content which you believe will add value to you in your life and content which is of high quality. But its also about the fact that you shouldn’t just read what everyone else is reading because how unique are you really if you just read everyone else’s thing which they are reading?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saint Christopher's Blog</name></author><category term="Lifestyle" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Controlling Others</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/controlling-others/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Controlling Others" /><published>2022-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Controlling-Others</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/controlling-others/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/blogs/anger/anger1.png&quot; alt=&quot;anger&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article I will talk about controlling others and this is something I see a lot of people get away with and people often have their own foolish justifications for this kind of behaviour where they are so controlling of other people. But generally, when we meet such people, we should aim to be forgiving of them for they no not what they do to others and themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, controlling others comes under the jurisdiction of evil weather the people that try to control others realize this or not. This is because to make someone conform to your beliefs or ways of thinking hinders the freedom of others and so it restricts things like soul growth and progress towards God and progress in spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, control over others bring about people’s suffering because you can’t control the actions of others truly because we all have free will. Granted the people that seek to control others think they are doing a good thing and getting away with what they do and seek to hide what they do when they control others because these kinds of people just want order, but in trying to control others and their ideas and beliefs and actions they just get disorder because the person being controlled doesn’t agree with these things because they don’t agree with it in their heart and so in subtle ways so things which undermine that control and I don’t think that people that try to control others through fear, anger, resentment, jealousy, envy etc realize that we all have free will weather they like it or not. Its also about how people have very subtle ways of seeking to control others which they themselves are not actually aware of – hence why it’s so important to be forgiving of these kinds of people, but generally these kinds of people will seek control over others because of how they falsely believe that others are the cause of their own suffering – when in fact this is not true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, it should be under the authority to those who are controlled or think they are being controlled unjustly to pray for those that seek to control them and make them conform to their own delusions, beliefs, ideas and make them take actions in things out of conformity because it is evil to seek to control others in this fashion. Also, you should assess why it is you conform to their control and perhaps take up journaling and write about why it is you think you conform to others control, is it out of compliance etc? Feel Free to read my article on this &lt;a href=&quot;/journaling/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; But those who do this shouldn’t be frowned upon and should be shown love, sympathy, compassion, understanding etc. Feel free to refer to my article on prayer. It also the duty of those who think they are being controlled to not allow themselves to be controlled because to allow yourself to be controlled by others in a way detrimental to you goes against thou shall not kill and thou shall not lie because you kill who you are and you lie about who you are to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also if you feel you are controlling others and suffer from this form of evil seek to take up prayer and pray to God or whoever you believe in and pray that you reduce this evil and this form of control that you seek to bring about in the world because it will reduce your own suffering immensely and make you much happier when you just let go of things and let go of your attachment to control others. Also I feel that meditation helps considerably in not being controlled by others because you just go deeper within and notice things alot more that are holding you back in terms of your own growth. I linked my article on this &lt;a href=&quot;/meditation/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, it’s in everyone’s best interests to avoid trying to control others because it will only bring about your own suffering because as I said we all have free will weather those with I’ll intent realize this or not. If you think you are being controlled by others seek to pray for them and you can find my article on prayer &lt;a href=&quot;/prayer/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; and those who think they are controlling others seek to pray that you reduce your evil ways because it will only bring about your own suffering trying to control others when you realize that things like fear, anger, jealousy, gluttony will only control people so much and people will disagree with you at times and so you can’t always get your way of control weather you like it or not and so will inevitably suffer from attempting to control others. Of course, we shouldn’t judge those who do seek to control others because they are lost in their ways of trying to control others when they are not able to because of free will, granted they may get some weak form of control, but they can never control others fully and so will inevitably cause them suffering and its up to those who seek to control others to change for their own benefit. Nobody can take that leap of faith so to speak for them, they have to do it themselves but praying for them will almost certainly help them to change for their own benefit and the world’s benefit. Feel free to give my article on Being Authentic and True to yourself &lt;a href=&quot;/being-authentic-and-true-to-yourself/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; which may help you if you think you are being controlled by others in ways detrimental to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article I will talk a little bit about Right Mindfulness which is something which really does bring you out of suffering and is something which I have mastered. Right mindfulness should first come in recognizing that you are not your mind, which so many people in our society seem to believe that they are their minds, this is just untrue. We also have a society in which the monkey minds as Buddhists put it so eloquently in that our minds are on autopilot and often people don’t have much control over their minds because there are so many people who don’t bother to take up things like meditation which help them to come out of their monkey mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key aspect of mastering right mindfulness is you need to meditate because its only after much meditation that you are able to stop allowing your mind to run rampant or lessen the impact of the monkey mind. Feel free to give my article on meditation on the way in which I have been meditating for about 4 years now which you can find on this blog. It took me a long time of meditation to actually achieve right mindfulness, so please don’t be deterred if you are not able to achieve right mindfulness in a few weeks of meditation – it takes a long time in meditation to recognize why listening to our minds all the time cause suffering and a long time in meditation to be able to not allow your monkey mind to dominate your life as I have seen so many people have in their lives – which is unfortunate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my general advice would be to spend more time contemplating on the noble four truths because the noble four truths are indeed the means out of suffering and everyone would do well in recognizing the great wisdoms that the Buddha has sent to us on earth. Which is a big promise that you can end your suffering, but it is true and has proven very true in my life. But of course, I am still learning and have a long way to go as do we all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right mindfulness also goes hand in hand with right concentration because you are able to concentrate that much better when you are able to be mindful and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I believe that right mindfulness is a very important part of the eightfold path and everyone that reads this should seek to meditate and contemplate a lot more on the noble four truths because they are indeed universal wisdoms that the Buddha has blessed us with on this earth and we would do well to adhere to his teachings because his teachings were a great blessing to us on this earth. I will soon be writing an article on misconceptions that people have on Buddhism to clear up some things which I feel we as a society has greatly misunderstood Buddhism and I feel that is partly due to how its taught in schools and how the media portrays it and how there is great emphasis on monks and the clothing used and how they shave their hair etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article I will be talking about when someone does wrong to you and how you should respond to that or if you do wrong to yourself and how you should deal with that. This is a touchy subject for me because I have caused myself many wrongs in my life and not been as true to myself as I should be and sought depth to myself because I never really accepted myself and who I truly am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will first talk about when others do wrong to you. You should first seek to understand why they have done wrong to you and appreciate that two wrongs don’t make a right no matter how hard you try. Or in other words generally you don’t fight fire with fire, then you should be loving towards the person that did wrong by you because they didn’t truly know the wrong that they did and what impact that had on you and the rest of the world. Once you understand and love that person, you then forgive them for what they did to you and then turn the other check in what they did and don’t think too much on it. This is a fundamental principal that all should seek to live by. So it should be a process of understanding =&amp;gt; loving =&amp;gt; forgiving =&amp;gt; turning the other cheek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I will talk about when you do wrong to yourself – which is for me a much, much harder one to do because its yourself and you should love nobody no less. But the same principal should be applied in that you should first seek to understand the person (yourself) that committed that wrong against yourself, once you understand why that wrong was committed to you then love that person (yourself), you then forgive yourself for the wrong that you did to yourself. And then turn the other check and move on and don’t dwell on negative thoughts towards yourself because it doesn’t achieve anything and just causes further harm to the world and yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me it’s been difficulty because I haven’t been very kind towards myself or as loving as I should have been and so have all these terrible habits and behaviors which just betray me, and the world and it has made me very upset inside and annoyed and frustrated at myself for all the times I’ve betrayed myself. But I should appreciate that it simply isn’t my fault, and I am blameless in the things I’ve done to myself and the times I’ve hurt others at my own expense because I just betray myself and the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the hardest part about understanding =&amp;gt; loving =&amp;gt; forgiving =&amp;gt; turning the other cheek, is turning the other cheek. This is the hardest part because people just want others to blame for their own suffering and their own egos with things like pride, arrogance, selfishness sometimes evilness can get in the way a lot of time in following this process. But it’s important to consider that what one human is capable of we are all capable of – even someone like Jesus who can perform miracles and even the most abject sinners in the world. What one human is capable of we are all capable of. Therefore, it’s important to realize and accept that you are not better than anyone else because you don’t give way to evil or lustful thoughts or are better than others because you yourself don’t commit the same sins, or better than others for your own advancements. You should accept that what one human is capable of we are all capable of nobody how noble that person is or how much of a sinner that person is we are all equal under the eyes of God because we are all human end of the day, even extraterrestrials…&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saint Christopher's Blog</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><category term="Jesus" /><category term="Jesus Second Coming" /><category term="God" /><category term="Christianity" /><category term="Extraterrestrials" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Being Authentic and True to Yourself</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/being-authentic-and-true-to-yourself/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Being Authentic and True to Yourself" /><published>2022-03-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-03-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Being-Authentic-and-True-to-Yourself</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/being-authentic-and-true-to-yourself/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000//assets/blogs/true/true.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Being Authentic and True to Yourself&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(No that is not me in the photo, its just a generic photo which I thought would go well with the theme of this article of staying true to yourself)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this short post I will talk a little about why it’s so important to be authentic and true to yourself and do what is right in your heart and not the hearts of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you don’t do right in terms of what is right in your heart you lose yourself and who you truly are and give way to others reasoning which may be faulty because others have their own lives and their own flaws, and you should appreciate that sometimes you know more than others and so should make your own judgements on when and when you don’t know better than others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its also about being clean because when you listen to others reasoning and their stupidity and foolishness it has an impact on yourself because you go with things that you don’t agree with and so you just become unclean and lose yourself and what you truly stand for in life, which is in a way a form of lying because you lie to yourself and lie to others in terms of who you truly are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I guess the key thing with this, is to see the other person as just another person of this world and see that they themselves are far from perfect and so you shouldn’t judge others mistakes and judge people for their flaws and ‘foolishness’ because as Jesus once said “Father forgive them, they know not what they do” because in a way it plays into realities, and nobody can possibly know the deeper realities to their own reality and so they don’t realize the consequences of their actions, hence why Jesus was a master of this world, he understood this key principal. Whether we like it or not, we all sin because we are all not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its also about fooling others, because people know, but more importantly God knows if you are not being authentic to who you really are. Yet people fool themselves on who they really are, which is quite sad, but is the way of the world and we shouldn’t judge those whom fool themselves in this way because as I understand nobody on earth is actually perfect, so we all have our own sins that we commit, but because we don’t realize the sins we commit we should be more forgiving to others when we see that they commit sin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, its about filling your house so to speak things which are apart of you and not filling your house with junk from others and taking on other people’s problems which then has an impact on you in terms of you then become influenced by them and take on their flaws and negative traits because you are not being true to yourself. Hence why its so important for each and every person to strive be as true to themselves as they can possibly be and not do things because I write about it on this blog, but do things which are true in their hearts regardless of what others say or do and also its important so as I have put an ‘act’ on for so long because you lie to yourself and it is a form of sin, this is why its so important to be forgiving to others and yourself especially because everyone is far from perfect and everyone no mattar who they are have their own flaws and negative traits that they have. Equally we shouldn’t judge those who are not authentic to themselves and be forgiving to those who are not authentic and as I said once in a note “Leave others to their own foolishness and don’t try to help those who don’t want help and don’t try to take on other people’s problems, you have your own problems to be dealing with”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we should be more trustful of ourselves and who we really are and not listen to the advice of others when we feel we know better than others, but equally we should listen to others whom we feel know better than we do, because as I said we are all far from perfect and so we shouldn’t judge the actions of others and should strive to be more forgiving of the sins of others because they don’t know the deeper realities of the sins that they commit, so its up to the individual to understand as and when others are sinning. We should also strive to be more respectful of others even if they sin against us because they are apart of life and we are far from perfect and because all is one to not be respectful to everything is not in line with reality, but the key thing is to be respectful towards yourself and your own feelings on mattars.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saint Christopher's Blog</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Third Noble Truth</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/the-third-noble-truth/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Third Noble Truth" /><published>2022-03-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-03-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/The-Third-Noble-Truth</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/the-third-noble-truth/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/blogs/Buddhism/Statue.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Truths&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this short article I will talk about the third noble truth that the Buddha described. To recap the first noble truth is that life is inherently dukka and you can read my article about this &lt;a href=&quot;/the-first-noble-truth/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;  and then the second noble truth is that dukka has a cause and that cause arises from within us through what he described as wanting/thirst/trying/desire and you can give my article on this second noble truth &lt;a href=&quot;/the-second-noble-truth/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third noble truth simply states that which is subject to arising is also subject to ceasing. That ending of dukka, the ending of confusion, sorry and loss is nirvana. The Buddha described nirvana as unborn, ungrown and unconditioned. The Buddha argued in the second noble truth that this dukka arises from within us and so therefore we are the cause of dukka because we don’t understand the way of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I equate in my mind the third noble truth to what goes up must inevitably come down, it’s just a question of when it comes down, similar how in life you find people taking it out on others – their own suffering and it’s understandable because they don’t see the truth in the way of the world and you can’t blame them because its not their fault why they don’t see the way of the world. Eventually though all people who take it out on others their own suffering will incur a cost in the afterlife or karma as Buddhism describes it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Buddha also sees that our actions, our speech, and our thoughts are geared towards bringing about some kind of control. Then, when these efforts inevitably fail, we suffer. The Buddha doesn’t ask us to give up control. Instead, it acknowledges that we never had it in the first place. I know this is quite deep and it took me a long time to really fully grasp this understanding, because in my life I have attempted to exert control over others because I thought they were the cause of my suffering, when in fact it was myself who was causing myself my own suffering – which is quite a sad truth for me to actually realize because I have taken it out on others my own suffering and not been as compassionate to myself as I should be because I feel the need to be punished all the time because I feel the need to be punished and so this has hurt my friendships a lot and people whom are close to me because I just don’t want to hurt them and so have learned somewhat to avoid people and put a shield around myself because I think that others are the cause of my own suffering when in fact it is myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So more on the third noble truth, it essentially says to let go of attachment and desire because any desire and attachment to anything will inevitably cause dukka. This is quite a difficult thing for many to do because like I said they just want control mainly as an attempt to end their own suffering and so can make others suffer as I have done as a result of an attempt to end their own suffering. Therefore, its beholden upon each individual who understand the four noble truths to be more forgiving, loving, compassionate and understanding to those who don’t yet understand the nature of reality and the way of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this isn’t to say that you shouldn’t love others, your family, your spouse etc. because you should, because you can love others and love your spouse without being attached to them which took me some contemplation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spend some time contemplating in meditation these truths and some time testing their validity by putting them to the test in your life, because the Buddha and others Buddha’s after him have extremely wise teachings and we would all do very well putting efforts to understand these noble truths that the Buddha has blessed us with in the world because like I said they are extremely wise and so if you want to end your own suffering then spend more time contemplating on these truths and meditating on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also be putting out my understanding of the eightfold path and each of them in separate articles on this blog so be sure to stay tuned for those articles because the Buddha argued that the eightfold path is actually the way out of suffering, which I tend to agree with, but don’t fully accept yet because I am still fairly new to Buddhism and have been putting a lot of effort to really understand the Buddha’s teachings and apply them to my own life because it is very wise teachings from a master of this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, you shouldn’t be deterred by the perception that you have of Buddhism and that modern society has given us, because Buddhism isn’t simply being a monk and living like a monk your whole life – its more so a way of living. There are lots of people who have lived and been good Buddhists and still managed to live ordinary lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small list of interesting people who are Buddhists is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhammawiki.com/index.php/List_of_Celebrity_Buddhists&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; to name a few&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article I will give my rough understanding of the alien topic. Which has nowadays become virtually a household topic. Most of the information I have received here has been from The Great White Brotherhood’s book “Aliens the Strange Truth” and you can find a link to that book &lt;a href=&quot;https://thegreatwhitebrotherhood.org/books/aliens-the-strange-truth/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the true aliens are very similar to humans but are entirely inter-dimensional that is they live in between dimensions and can enter our realities if they do so choose and as with humans you have good ones and bad ones. But they are actually brought about from people’s unused personality bundles so if you have a human who is full of joy and happy and positive then you will most likely produce an alien of similar traits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aliens have of course their own agendas with things, and some have similar if not the same agendas as us humans and so we are able to work alongside the aliens to have a positive effect on humanity and the world if we do so choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, you also have the grey aliens who are actually demonic in nature and work with intelligence agencies to produce a disastrous effect on the world. Of course, it is their choice if they want to work alongside actual demons and invite them into their reality, but that is their choice. Which I of course disagree with because to work alongside demons is terribly foolish, I guess it’s a question of what those humans that work alongside them really want, but its sad because they don’t know what they really want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, the true aliens which are humanity’s unused personality bundles serve life and are very advanced compared to us humans and so we would do well as a species to listen to them and their advice for humanity because they know much more than we currently do in our current stage of advancement. But of course, that isn’t to say that the aliens are here to take us over. The good aliens are here to help us. I leave humanity to judge the intentions of aliens because as I said some are good and some are bad, and some work with other species going back thousands of years. So its up to humanity if aliens are ever disclosed to the public by our Governments if these aliens are acutally here to help us, or if they are here to enslave us alongside our politicians - I leave you who read this article to be the judge of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there were to be aliens come to our planet in an ideal world we would treat them with respect and love (even the bad true aliens) because aliens are as much apart of life as we are and we have the right to life as they do, but that isn’t to say that we should judge the actions of aliens because they work on much higher levels of reality and we would be wise as a species to not condemn their actions out of hand because they know a lot more than we do about many things, the good aliens work alongside The Great White Brotherhood (you can read more about The Great White Brotherhood on the about page) in serving man also because they have the same objectives which is to help people and assist man incarnate and discarnate and we as a species could never do with enough help in promoting things like peace, love etc.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saint Christopher's Blog</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Finding your Ideal Partner</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/finding-your-ideal-partner/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Finding your Ideal Partner" /><published>2022-03-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-03-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Finding-your-Ideal-Partner</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/finding-your-ideal-partner/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/blogs/Ideal-partner/partner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Partner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this short article I will talk a little about finding your ideal partner. Now I feel that many people unfortunately don’t actually know how to find their ideal partner, which I think is unfortunate because I would like to see a world where everyone meets their ideal partner in life, because the world would be a lot more beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the trick with finding your ideal partner is dead simple. All you need to do is sit somewhere quietly and say a short prayer to God telling him that you are ready to receive your ideal partner in life and thank him for sending you your ideal partner. Now of course it may take a number of weeks/months/years for you to finally meet in person, but you will have your guides/Gods angels helping to pull the strings so to speak so that you two are able to meet in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you meet your ideal partner, I am told that it is like an explosion when you finally meet for the first time. However, both you and your ideal partner sometimes need to change before you meet in order for you to be a couple and for you to have a loving, long lasting successful relationship with each other. An example of something that may need to change is your understanding of the opposite gender (or same gender if you are homosexual). Especially I find with men in our society we have a lot of toxic masculinity which are behaviors which you believe make you a man – but don’t, because as I found out you define who a man should be – which thus makes a man a man. Equally a woman defines what a woman should be – which makes a woman a woman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, don’t beat yourself up too much if you haven’t had much experience with the opposite gender even if you are at an old age in life. There is always room for growth no matter how much you think you know. But seek to say this short prayer if you are still without your ideal partner and don’t think that you are silly for saying this prayer if you don’t prayer often. But seek to be the best version of yourself and being so full of sexual frustration isn’t in my opinion being the best version of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
