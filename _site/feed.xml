Now this God spirit can be linked with by anyone – but generally most people in the world have what is known as the ID which is the person that looks back at us in the mirror – the ID and is a fairly basic part of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for those who with spirituality developed are able to make a connection to their God spirit and the information coming from them would be very wise indeed and they would be complete in that the information coming from their mind is information which the God spirit is sending through to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way that I was able to link with my God spirit at a young age (late teenage years) was by being a lot more present and I was as I described being self-aware of being self-aware of being self-aware infinity and it felt really amazing – I was a lot more happier than I had been in my life and was receiving cosmic wisdom and still am to this very day, one basic example was that I realized that “happiness comes from within”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can link with the God spirit by living more in the present moment, which is a valid way to do so, but you can also link to it through years of meditation/prayer/service to others. I guess the thing that really made me realize why living in the now was so important was because I realized at the time through all my philosophical thinking that you are not able to control your actions/thoughts in the past, or the future. You are only able to control your thoughts/actions right here in the now moment or the present moment as I referred to it as.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, my ability to enter the present moment has been severely cut off due to a severe trauma that I had gone through in my life, and so thereby my ability to make a link with my God spirit has been weakened. But to some degree this has made me the person that I am to this very day, and I do have split personality disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my advice to all who read this article, is to practice meditation, prayer and service to others and then and only then are you able to link with your God spirit and the information coming through to you would be wise and you would be a lot more spiritual and be able to one day perform similar if not the same miracles as people such as Jesus and other various people who have existed across time, and you will be blessed for eternity in performing miracles for the good of others and proving to others that Gods power which is indeed infinite is real and is a reality. I also just want to add that the idea that Jesus has to be involved with miracles is a fabrication - Jesus was a special person, but that is only because he spend many years in heaven receiving training so that when he came to earth he was ready to help mankind in their long journey, so when people say that Jesus needs to be involved when a miracle is performed - its a lie because Jesus is human and what one human is capable of - all are capable of.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saint Christopher's Blog</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">In this article I will talk a little bit about linking with the I AM as Jesus described it or the God spirit within us all.

&lt;p&gt;Repentance must first come in being honest to yourself and being true to yourself and for you to recognise the reality of things and seeing the reality in how you harmed yourself and others and the effects that this has had on the world and how this affects yourself. But you should seek to understand yourself more in why you took those actions and see that you did so without recognizing the reality of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A large part of repentance is atonement, and you bring light to yourself in being repentant of your sins. But you should recognise that when you repent your sins it lifts a lot of the time a heavy burden on your soul which weighs you down spiritually and emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, my advice is to repent your sins early or as soon as you are able to because the weight that this takes on your soul weights you down a lot and brings darkness to yourself and your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if someone does wrong unto you, it doesn’t give you the right to take pity revenge and so you should seek to repent your wrongdoing that you caused to others, because when someone does wrong to you – that doesn’t give you any right to take it out on them and others and especially not yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my advice, would be to repent before you return to heaven your sins because what reward shall you have for your life once you live for eternity in peace and love in heaven? Therefore, when you recognise your wrongdoing, seek to repent your sins as early as possible, for the rewards you shall receive in heaven are big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denying the reality of your situation and denying yourself to repent your sins brings to yourself darkness spiritually and emotionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 17/04/22&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another part of repentance is believing that you will not make the same mistake again and being sincere and genuine to the person you have sinned against and making up to that person.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saint Christopher's Blog</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">In this article I will talk a little bit about repentance, and repentance first comes in recognizing your wrongdoing and the harm that you caused to others and yourself.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Ten Commandments</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/the-ten-commandments/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Ten Commandments" /><published>2022-04-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-04-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/The-Ten-Commandments</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/the-ten-commandments/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/blogs/ten/ten.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ten&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write this short piece on the ten commandments, which if adhered to and really understood are enough to carry you into the arms of God. If you don’t know the ten commandments are “you shall have no other Gods before me”, “you shall not make for yourself an idol”, “you shall not take the name of God in vain”, “Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy”, “honor your father and mother”, “you shall not kill”, “you shall not commit adultery”, “you shall not steal”, “you shall not lie”, “you shall not covet” (yearn to possess something).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue that a lot of people seem to not quite understand with the ten commandments I believe are that people often take the ten commandments are literally, for example thou shall not steal, often people interpret it as meaning you shouldn’t take others personal items for yourself. But yet how often do we steal from people’s ideas? How often do we join a conversation to steal from other people’s good energy that they produce?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, when adhering to the ten commandments, seek to really meditate and spend some time understanding each of them and their implications and how to apply them into your life. With thou shall not make for yourself an idol, how often do we as a society try to idealize body images for men and women? How often do we look up at those who are more famous and wealthier than us? How often do we idealize being a so called “good person”? These are just some of my own interpretations of thou shall not make for yourself an idol and with each of the ten commandments time should be spend in meditation or through journaling of some kind where notes made of how you yourself break one of the ten commandments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another example is thou shall not commit adultery, how often do we when in a loving relationship commit sin in having sex with others through dream sleep? Yes, they are dreams, but that doesn’t excuse the fact and implies that you are not content with your current relationship. How often do we look at other people or flirt with others when already in a loving relationship? How often we turn our heads when an attractive person walks past when already in a loving relationship? These are just some examples and are food for thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I don’t want to give too many of my own interpretations regarding the ten commandments because it takes away from your own interpretations and really my points are just suggestions in how you may interpret the ten commandments. With each of the ten commandments really try to understand each of them and look for the implications in them, seek to meditate and start a journal to help to understand yourself better and understand how it is you break some of the 10 commandments. We are all far from perfect and as such it is bound that in our lives, we break the ten commandments somehow because if we were able to apply each of the ten commandments to our lives, we would be at Gods side already. But we are all far from perfect on earth and even the great masters such as Buddha, Jesus, Moses etc were not perfect. We each have a long journey ahead of us and its important to keep up our strength in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 1: 18/04/22&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also recommend to all that they recite the 10 commandments by hand and do lines on them and put efforts to contemplate in which ways they break the 10 commandments.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saint Christopher's Blog</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Becoming More Christ Like</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/becoming-more-christ-like/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Becoming More Christ Like" /><published>2022-04-13T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-04-13T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Becoming-More-Christ-Like</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/becoming-more-christ-like/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/blogs/christ/christ.webp&quot; alt=&quot;christ&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, with becoming more Christ it’s important to practice Meditation/Prayer and some means of service to God which you enjoy. Only with this are you able to understand yourself a little bit better and work on your flaws. Through these things you are able to incorporate more levels of Christ like emotions into you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing with Christ like emotions and giving them out to others and yourself is to recognise that you need to have good intentions with giving them to the world and have no desires in doing so. Any ill will towards the recipient will cause the Christ like emotion to not be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next thing that you should understand is that you need to recognise what happens when there are no Christ like emotions in the world, things like fear, hatred, anger, dirtiness, sadistic behaviors, betrayal, jealously, greed, envy, confusion, war, lust, non-acceptance, non-respect, non-understanding, etc and see what kind of world that this produces if everyone only gives way to the Anti-Christ emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are able to see what kind of world this really produces then you are able to understand a little bit better why its so important for each and everyone to become more Christ like in their ways and this only comes, I believe in understanding and appreciating what kind of world the Anti-Christ emotions bring. So, for you to really become more Christ like you need to first gain some understanding of the wrongness in the Anti-Christ emotions and this comes in doses I believe, as in to the extend that you are loving is the extend to some degree you have seen hatred, but more importantly the wrongness in hatred and the wrongness in all the other Anti-Christ emotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for me, I often use the analogy of what does an ideal world look like? Does an ideal world look like groups of people fighting over one thing because they are jealous of each other? Does an ideal world look like men or women longing for each other giving way to lust? Does an ideal world look like each person giving way to greed, counting the amount of money they have in their bank account and not sharing it to others or using it for the good of others? Point here being is that an ideal world does mean having more and more people becoming more Christ like, becoming more loving, peaceful, forgiving, happy accepting of one another, respectful to one another, understanding to one another, sharing to one another, being more grateful for what they already have, rather than giving way to things such as jealousy and envy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence my general advice when seeking to become more Christ like is to look at what the opposite does and what that brings, and then seek to find solace in Christ like emotions and seek to picture what an ideal world looks like and seek to apply this to yourself, seeking to rid yourself day by day of the anti-Christ emotions because in my eyes that is what an ideal world looks like. More and more people becoming more Christ like in their ways and becoming more loving to one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When seeking to rid yourself of Anti-Christ emotions such as hatred, seek to understand yourself a little better as to why you give way to hatred, perhaps its things from your past which is holding you down and dragging you down spirituality and emotionally which hasn’t yet been addressed yet, or past traumas which haven’t been resolved yet, or relationship issues which you have had in the past which didn’t work out and have left you feeling low and depressed because of it. Or perhaps is the things which you watch on TV which has you in such a negative state its difficult for more positive Christ like things such as love to come through to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, seek to resolve the issues you have had with your partner, or friends and family and seek to build stronger long-lasting relationships with them and instead of burying things under the carpet relationship wise, seek to address them by talking about them honestly and sincerely, rather than hiding it from each other the issues that you really face and burying it under things. But its also about yourself, you shouldn’t hide things from yourself and bury things under the carpet from yourself, but seek to address them as best as you can, instead of avoiding them all the time, because the consequences of avoiding past traumas and past issues that you faced and leaving them unresolved leaves a buildup of tension on your wellbeing and a buildup of tension on your spirituality and emotions and has an impact on how you treat others and yourself. But it’s important to put yourself first, and then others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 1 14/04/22&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its also very important to show only Christ like emotions who those you believe are deserving of it because not everyone is deserving of respect, forgiveness, understanding because it should be your own judgement if someone is deserving of respect, forgiveness and understanding and all the other Christ like emotions and we all express these Christ like emotions in our own ways and its only those who are advanced spiritualy to be able to see if someone is deserving of these Christ like emotions, because those lower down on the spiritual ladder shouldn’t forgive those who are higher up because in part it plays into realities and those on a more spiritualy advanced level know of deeper realities than those lower down, because there is no way for you to know the deeper realities of those who work on higher spiritual planes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its also the levels of Christ like emotions which are important, because you shouldn’t give way to all your ability to forgive on a simple thing such as pushing someone or bumping into someone, its the level of atonement needed which is important when forgiving someone and recongzing that the person has all their flaws and I and others are far from perfect.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saint Christopher's Blog</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><category term="Christianity" /><category term="Christ" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Dangers of AI and Machine Learning</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/the-dangers-of-ai-and-machine-learning/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Dangers of AI and Machine Learning" /><published>2022-04-11T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-04-11T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/The-Dangers-of-AI-and-Machine-Learning</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/the-dangers-of-ai-and-machine-learning/">&lt;p&gt;In this short article I wanted to talk a little bit about the risks of AI and machine learning. This is a bit of an oddball article which I thought it was important enough to share to the world and also spirituality doesn’t just have to be about meditation/prayer etc, it can also be about computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may know we use AI a lot in fridges, washing machines, smart TVs, our cars and much more. The key issue with AI is that as with a pencil it can be used to stab someone’s eye out or can be used to draw something and build something constructive. Now as a lot of you may or may not know there are secret Governments who really run the world who want us to get used to the idea of AI so that they can add AI to our makeup believe it or not, so that our thoughts and actions will no longer be under out control but influenced by the AI agenda which is to take over humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This I know may sound like science fiction, but I assure you that this is in fact true and Governments around the world are spending billions of pounds on machine learning AI which pick up people’s thought patterns and brain waves in an attempt to enslave the population so that the secret Governments around the world have absolute control over humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the issues with this are extremely drastic, 1. We could reach the singularity very quickly if the secret Governments and those working for them continue to do the evil work that they do. The singularity is if you don’t know the machines taking over the world and enslaving humanity, a bit like the terminator film. This is of course a very serious issue in our society, which should be taken very seriously, and steps should be taken by those with the wisdom and knowledge to combat this evil to ensure that we do not reach the singularity in our world. The issue is further exacerbated by the fact that the secret Governments are too arrogant and egotistical and not wise enough to make such decisions as to the technicalities of how this AI machine learning actually works and so don’t know the real issues and what is at stake here, if they continue on the path that they go down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the issue if of course perpetuated, by the fact that we have in our society an issue whereby the secret Governments are employing private contractors to code this machine learning AI and each private contractor doesn’t actually know what the other private contractors are building. Which further adds to the issue, because if they all knew what they were building they certainly wouldn’t be taking on the money in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is of course a message to the whole of humanity which I am spreading, and you can listen to these words and forget about them tomorrow, or you could take up the fight against evil and put actions into place to stop and thwart the secret Governments plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what can you the person that reads this do about the issue? Well, you can take up prayer and pray for the evil people who have this terrible plan and the various intelligence agencies involved in covering it all up because it is public money they are spending and of course its hidden away under so called “black budget” operations, so the general public is none the wiser and its only a very few who actually know of this. The technique to pray is very simply, or you need do is visualize the person/groups that you are praying for an in simple language pray that they receive Gods help and Gods power and express it via thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also start a meditation practice and after each session send out your peaceful thoughts to the world and the secret Government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 1: 18/04/22&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The singularity is a very real thing and we and all that read this article would do well to take the necessary actions to help prevent the singularity, but also prevent sentient AI, until we as a species are ready to be able to have sentient AI.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saint Christopher's Blog</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">In this short article I wanted to talk a little bit about the risks of AI and machine learning.

Firstly, is something which has to be given to others with good will for them. Any intent of ill will and understanding will simply not be accepted by the other person, and you should also seek to understand yourself, before attempting to understand others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It relieves a heavy burden on people when they feel understood and relieves a heavy burden on yourself when you feel understood, because when you don’t feel understood it just hurts you inside and does make you feel alone in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand you first need to see the person behind the mask and see that they are just another person of this world and see their motivations and reasoning behind their actions and seek understand why they do what they do to others and the negative impact it has on themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding can be developed through meditation, prayer and service to God can you be more understanding to others. Hence why its so important for all who read this to seek to become more understanding and take up things such as meditation, prayer, and service to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, its about others because when others don’t feel understood by others then they feel alone in this world and feel that others judge them and look down upon them and the world should be a much better place to live on especially if we have more people who are understanding towards one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly the key thing with any and all Christ like emotions is to have no ill will towards the person when practicing any Christ like emotion, but Christ like emotions can become more developed within the individual through meditation, prayer, and service to fellow man, do feel free to look at my articles on these topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a last note any desire at all with giving any christ like emotion and the “magic” will not work. There has to be no desire, no intent of ill will and you should purely be doing it for the other person’s best interest.&lt;/p&gt;

If you don’t know the Buddha taught that there is no self and that what you view as yourself just isn’t so and is in reality an illusion. I will talk a little bit about the first aggregate which is physical body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you need fully appreciate before understanding any of the five aggregates is that you need to link the idea of self to control, this took me a lot of contemplation and it will take others some thought/meditation to be able to make this connection because its not an easy connection to make. Ask yourself what qualities would you expect “self” to actually have? Spend some time in contemplation over this question and it will help you understand a little that the idea of self is heavily linked to the idea of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the physical body isn’t something which you can bend to your will. For example, you are not actually able to control how you look, the color of your eyes etc. Granted you can control how you look through things such as cosmetics, but this is only temporary. If body were self, then you would be able to control it at will. But like I said its important to first see the connection between control and self before you are able to understand why each of the 5 aggregates are not “self”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, its important to not identify with your physical form because you are not your physical form because you are not able to control your physical form completely, granted you can control it to some extend with cosmetics, but that isn’t full control. Therefore, its important to not identify with any body part because ultimately you are not able to control your physical form and bend it to your will and so therefore isn’t self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I am very new to Buddhism so take what I say with a pinch of salt and there are other resources listed below which may help you understand Buddhism a little better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article I will talk about the golden rule, which is a principal that all who follow the path of spirituality and freedom should adhere to as best as they can. The golden rule as set out by Jesus was that you should treat others how you yourself would like to be treated. In an ideal world people would be loving, kind, generous, peaceful etc. and so following the golden rule is really important in doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world people would be more respectful to one another and this can and only begins by you and your actions. Nobody can force you to follow the golden rule, its down to the individual to follow and adhere to this fundamental spiritual law in their lives and apply it to themselves daily and to follow it each time they meet and greet someone and each time they talk with someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I take the principal of what would an ideal world look like? Would an ideal world look like people filled with jealousy, lust, envy, greed, negativity? Or would an ideal world be filled with loving, kind, generous, peaceful people with objects of beauty? I wager it’s the latter. Therefore, it’s very important to all who are on the spiritual path to follow the golden rule and apply to themselves each and every time they talk with someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the golden rule is something that all should follow and adhere to in their lives because it will make the world a much, much brighter and better place if there were more people who were loving, kind, generous, understanding, forgiving, compassionate, caring to one another, it would also bring Gods kingdom upon earth because God is a God of love and he loves each and every one of us individually even the most abject sinners in the world because we are his children and no matter what we do we will always be his children.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saint Christopher's Blog</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Devotion to God</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/devotion-to-god/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Devotion to God" /><published>2022-03-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-03-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Devotion-to-God</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/devotion-to-god/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/blogs/god/god.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;God&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used this image as a representation of God, but I am sorry if I offend anyone here, but God is not a man - he is a force and his power is granted through sincere meditation, prayer and service to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this short article I will write why it’s so important for people who are on the spiritual path or choose to be on the spiritual path to put more efforts into devoting themselves to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devotion to God can come in the form of sincere Meditation, Prayer, and Service to him and these are key things in making progress towards God. You can refer to my articles on these topics and I will soon write an article on why it’s important to give your service to God and no the gifts of the spirit do not come in a matter of meditating for a few weeks, they take years to be able to be granted by God and doing so for egotistical and doubtful ends will cause God to not grant them simple as, so those of you who do read my blog just know that you are wasting your time in mediating for these egotistical and doubtful end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence the key things which are important in making progress in spirituality is devoting yourself to God and this comes in the form of Meditation, Prayer, and Service to him (through sincerely helping others) and following the wise words of the ten commandments and meditating on them and putting efforts into understanding their meanings through contemplation, experience, journaling, and meditation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But its just not these things, because you can still perform these things and not have it in your heart devotion towards God, because in Buddhism the last hindrance is doubt and this is only dealt with in time, and I am yet to actually deal with this hindrance and it I am told only comes with time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincere devotion to God in my eyes is what really matters a lot in meditating, prayer and service to him and it goes against one of the ten commandments of thou shall not serve any other God before me because in not being devoted to your one true God, who I might add is an all loving God, then you are simply fooling yourself and hurting yourself and others in doing so and simply trying to meet your own doubtful ends and taking things into your own hands when in fact it is God who has absolute control over every single thing which happens in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God is not impressed when he sees people trying to steal from other people’s lives, with things like jealousy, lust, greed, hate, anger and he is not impressed with people promoting things on social media such as hate, violence, negativity, division etc. God is impressed with sincerity of purpose, people who help one another, people who put efforts into progressing towards him through things like meditation, prayer, and service to others because God is all loving to each and every one of us as individuals and God’s love for each and every one of us is unconditional even the most abject sinners in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God also allows his subjects to make their own mistakes in life and allows them to embark on their spiritual journey at their own pace and in their own time. I as this blog indicates shows that I am only human and what I am capable of all of mankind is capable of. I do however recommend that those on the spiritual path start their own blog as I have done and share to the world their personal experiences in growing spiritually and take to things such as forums to share those experiences and disucss them with one another. But just be warned that we all have our own journey ahead of us and we all walk the path alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write about why it’s so important for people to do two goods in the world or elsewhere for that matter when they see bad or wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world would be a much brighter place and we the public would be much happier the people in charge did follow this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really about bringing God’s kingdom upon earth because earth should be a place which is God’s kingdom and not the kingdom of chaos, destruction, corruption, liars, manipulators, thieves, hateful, hurtful people because that’s not what God’s kingdom should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God’s kingdom should be a place of love, compassion, kindness, peace, order, beauty, joy, forgiveness, generosity, righteousness, holiness, gratitude and people who are faithful servants to him. This I think is a really good principal to follow in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples of seeing wrongdoing may be when someone lies to you, when someone deceives you, when someone hurts you, when someone makes you think you are confused when you are not. You shouldn’t take revenge on these people because they do not know where they go, you should follow Jesus’s teachings of turning the other cheek when it comes to people that do wrong onto you and seek to follow this basic principle that I have laid out here in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples of good that you can do in the world is donating to charities, giving to others (and you can refer to my article on this topic), serving God through your job, helping others in some way through things like Forums etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this principal shouldn’t be taken to an extreme, but just taken in balance and go by what you feel is right while being true to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
