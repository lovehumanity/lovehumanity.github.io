This isn’t really my usual article, but I thought that this subject was important enough to share with the world because I feel that in modern society, we are so consumeristic what with being bombarded with advertisements on places like the television, the internet etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that is important when saving money is to look at your spending and be conservative with how much you are spending. Do you really need Disney+, Netflix, Amazon Prime and HBO Plus? When you are not watching anything on Amazon Prime? My advice is to review all your spending and things coming out of your account and seek to look at the spending that you are able to reduce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing to realize when seeking to save money is to ensure that you have an emergency fund in your bank of say £750 for emergency funds such as an emergency dental appointment, an emergency with a car repair etc. With having a reserve £750 in your bank then it will help to ensure that you don’t go into any overdraft with your bank and ensure that you are as debt free as possible. Of course, it doesn’t have to be £750, but needs to be a reasonable amount of money compared to your monthly income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to not put all your eggs in one basket so to speak and put all your life savings into investments, you should seek to ensure that you keep some of your life savings in a bank account or a savings account, but it’s important to strike a balance between savings in savings accounts and savings in investments. You shouldn’t put too much of your money into investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its also about yourself, because with saving money it will allow you to have those things in your life that you need, but don’t have such as a nice holiday and this motivates you to keep saving. It also allows you to help others by being able to give money to others who are more in need than you are, but just ensure that you don’t be greedy with money because its very easy to fall into this as I have in my life, because with greed you don’t appreciate the amount that you have and own, and so it takes away the value of the amount of money you really have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, seek to ensure that you keep a reasonable amount of money in your bank as an emergency fund and seek to ensure that you review your spending at the start of each month so that you can reduce your spending. This in turn will offer you more freedom in your life to use your hard-earned money as and when you choose and be more selective as to which businesses you support. Also, its about being kind to yourself, its your money that you earned and you shouldn’t be spending it on things which you don’t use or receive any value from.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saint Christopher's Blog</name></author><category term="Personal Finance" /><summary type="html">In this article I will be talking about why it’s so important that you save money.

The vast majority of the public are under some kind of illusion, it’s only those extremely enlightened that you could argue are not under a very big illusion. We all live in an illusion but its really just a question of to what extend are you under an illusion? The vast majority of the public are still under the control of their mind and have little freedom in my eyes compared to more enlightened people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people do not live in a deeper reality because it is detrimental to them and their wellbeing and so to live in an illusion is needed until the person is able to reach a deeper reality. My analogy for reality is a Matryoshka doll whereby you have a deeper reality each time you lift up the doll, but its important to realize that people need illusions or some level of illusions to be able to function effectively in society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their own reality in this world, but you shouldn’t try to make people conform to your reality. This can be done by ensuring that you go by society’s expectations of what it means to be normal and is something that I haven’t really given way to in the past because I just wanted to be special and, in my eyes, I think that everyone in their own way strives to be special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also realize that reality is made up of a few things your beliefs, thoughts and imagination and each one person has their own reality to which they confirm to, so its best to if you have obtained some freedom through things such as meditation and prayer, then its best to not boast about it to others because it threatens people’s reality to which they conform to and a lot of people will look in horror and what freedom actually is because they are so used to living in their own reality and it harms their sense of the world and is detrimental to the person as well mentally, emotionally and spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence why it’s important with all endeavors of spirituality to go at your own pace and to not give away the fact that you are a very free soul compared to others or go announcing it to the world that you are becoming a very free soul because it is detrimental to you and detrimental to others and detrimental to Gods kingdom in the sense that you harm others (Gods creation) and harm yourself (Gods creation).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saint Christopher's Blog</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">In this short article I will be talking a little bit about illusions.

Firstly, understanding comes on a deep level in the sense that it is in part a gift of the spirit and is something which has to be given to others with good will for them. Any intent of ill will and understanding will simply not be accepted by the other person, and you just lose yourself when you are not understanding to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It relieves a heavy burden on people when they feel understood and relieves a heavy burden on yourself when you feel understood, because when you don’t feel understood it just hurts you inside and does make you feel alone in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand you first need to see the person behind the mask and see that they are just another person of this world and see their motivations and reasoning behind their actions and seek understand why they do what they do to others and the negative impact it has on themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding is a gift of the spirit and through meditation, prayer and service to God can you be more understanding to others. Hence why its so important for all who read this to seek to become more understanding and take up things such as meditation, prayer, and service to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, its about others because when others don’t feel understood by others then they feel alone in this world and feel that others judge them and look down upon them and the world should be a much better place to live on especially if we have more people who are understanding towards one another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly the key thing with any and all Christ like emotions is to have no ill will towards the person when practicing any Christ like emotion, but Christ like emotions can become more developed within the individual through meditation, prayer, and service to fellow man, do feel free to look at my articles on these topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a last note any desire at all with giving any christ like emotion and the “magic” will not work. There has to be no desire, no intent of ill will and you should purely be doing it for the other person’s best interest.&lt;/p&gt;

If you don’t know the Buddha taught that there is no self and that what you view as yourself just isn’t so and is in reality an illusion. I will talk a little bit about the first aggregate which is physical body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you need fully appreciate before understanding any of the five aggregates is that you need to link the idea of self to control, this took me a lot of contemplation and it will take others some thought/meditation to be able to make this connection because its not an easy connection to make. Ask yourself what qualities would you expect “self” to actually have? Spend some time in contemplation over this question and it will help you understand a little that the idea of self is heavily linked to the idea of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the physical body isn’t something which you can bend to your will. For example, you are not actually able to control how you look, the color of your eyes etc. Granted you can control how you look through things such as cosmetics, but this is only temporary. If body were self, then you would be able to control it at will. But like I said its important to first see the connection between control and self before you are able to understand why each of the 5 aggregates are not “self”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, its important to not identify with your physical form because you are not your physical form because you are not able to control your physical form completely, granted you can control it to some extend with cosmetics, but that isn’t full control. Therefore, its important to not identify with any body part because ultimately you are not able to control your physical form and bend it to your will and so therefore isn’t self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I am very new to Buddhism so take what I say with a pinch of salt and there are other resources listed below which may help you understand Buddhism a little better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article I will talk about the golden rule, which is a principal that all who follow the path of spirituality and freedom should adhere to as best as they can. The golden rule as set out by Jesus was that you should treat others how you yourself would like to be treated. In an ideal world people would be loving, kind, generous, peaceful etc. and so following the golden rule is really important in doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world people would be more respectful to one another and this can and only begins by you and your actions. Nobody can force you to follow the golden rule, its down to the individual to follow and adhere to this fundamental spiritual law in their lives and apply it to themselves daily and to follow it each time they meet and greet someone and each time they talk with someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I take the principal of what would an ideal world look like? Would an ideal world look like people filled with jealousy, lust, envy, greed, negativity? Or would an ideal world be filled with loving, kind, generous, peaceful people with objects of beauty? I wager it’s the latter. Therefore, it’s very important to all who are on the spiritual path to follow the golden rule and apply to themselves each and every time they talk with someone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the golden rule is something that all should follow and adhere to in their lives because it will make the world a much, much brighter and better place if there were more people who were loving, kind, generous, understanding, forgiving, compassionate, caring to one another, it would also bring Gods kingdom upon earth because God is a God of love and he loves each and every one of us individually even the most abject sinners in the world because we are his children and no matter what we do we will always be his children.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saint Christopher's Blog</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Devotion to God</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/devotion-to-god/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Devotion to God" /><published>2022-03-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-03-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Devotion-to-God</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/devotion-to-god/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/blogs/god/god.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;God&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used this image as a representation of God, but I am sorry if I offend anyone here, but God is not a man - he is a force and his power is granted through sincere meditation, prayer and service to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this short article I will write why it’s so important for people who are on the spiritual path or choose to be on the spiritual path to put more efforts into devoting themselves to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devotion to God can come in the form of sincere Meditation, Prayer, and Service to him and these are key things in making progress towards God. You can refer to my articles on these topics and I will soon write an article on why it’s important to give your service to God and no the gifts of the spirit do not come in a matter of meditating for a few weeks, they take years to be able to be granted by God and doing so for egotistical and doubtful ends will cause God to not grant them simple as, so those of you who do read my blog just know that you are wasting your time in mediating for these egotistical and doubtful end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In essence the key things which are important in making progress in spirituality is devoting yourself to God and this comes in the form of Meditation, Prayer, and Service to him (through sincerely helping others) and following the wise words of the ten commandments and meditating on them and putting efforts into understanding their meanings through contemplation, experience, journaling, and meditation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But its just not these things, because you can still perform these things and not have it in your heart devotion towards God, because in Buddhism the last hindrance is doubt and this is only dealt with in time, and I am yet to actually deal with this hindrance and it I am told only comes with time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincere devotion to God in my eyes is what really matters a lot in meditating, prayer and service to him and it goes against one of the ten commandments of thou shall not serve any other God before me because in not being devoted to your one true God, who I might add is an all loving God, then you are simply fooling yourself and hurting yourself and others in doing so and simply trying to meet your own doubtful ends and taking things into your own hands when in fact it is God who has absolute control over every single thing which happens in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God is not impressed when he sees people trying to steal from other people’s lives, with things like jealousy, lust, greed, hate, anger and he is not impressed with people promoting things on social media such as hate, violence, negativity, division etc. God is impressed with sincerity of purpose, people who help one another, people who put efforts into progressing towards him through things like meditation, prayer, and service to others because God is all loving to each and every one of us as individuals and God’s love for each and every one of us is unconditional even the most abject sinners in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God also allows his subjects to make their own mistakes in life and allows them to embark on their spiritual journey at their own pace and in their own time. I as this blog indicates shows that I am only human and what I am capable of all of mankind is capable of. I do however recommend that those on the spiritual path start their own blog as I have done and share to the world their personal experiences in growing spiritually and take to things such as forums to share those experiences and disucss them with one another. But just be warned that we all have our own journey ahead of us and we all walk the path alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write about why it’s so important for people to do two goods in the world or elsewhere for that matter when they see bad or wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world would be a much brighter place and we the public would be much happier the people in charge did follow this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really about bringing God’s kingdom upon earth because earth should be a place which is God’s kingdom and not the kingdom of chaos, destruction, corruption, liars, manipulators, thieves, hateful, hurtful people because that’s not what God’s kingdom should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God’s kingdom should be a place of love, compassion, kindness, peace, order, beauty, joy, forgiveness, generosity, righteousness, holiness, gratitude and people who are faithful servants to him. This I think is a really good principal to follow in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples of seeing wrongdoing may be when someone lies to you, when someone deceives you, when someone hurts you, when someone makes you think you are confused when you are not. You shouldn’t take revenge on these people because they do not know where they go, you should follow Jesus’s teachings of turning the other cheek when it comes to people that do wrong onto you and seek to follow this basic principle that I have laid out here in this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples of good that you can do in the world is donating to charities, giving to others (and you can refer to my article on this topic), serving God through your job, helping others in some way through things like Forums etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course this principal shouldn’t be taken to an extreme, but just taken in balance and go by what you feel is right while being true to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article I will talk a little about Porn. Now Porn is a topic which many people in our society don’t like to discuss, but hide, like its something that should be hidden to the general public, when generally a lot of people watch it and consume it on daily basis and I think it should be brought to the forefront because its extremely wrong the kinds of porn that the industry promotes and the effect that this has on young people to this day and the effect that it has had on people’s lives, especially young people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The porn industry needs a major shift because the kinds of things that it promotes just isn’t righteous, things such as adultery which destroy families and ruin family life just isn’t right and the fact that mainstream porn industries promote this is very sinful in my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the effect it had on young people including myself will last people a lifetime and has had a major impact on society in terms of people’s mental health, wellbeing and spiritual development and development as people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It promotes these sinful scenarios and incest porn such as “step moms”, “step sisters”, “daughter swaps”, “step dads”, “step brothers” who have sex with each other and it effects people psychologically, mentally and emotionally and effects society as a whole. Of course, most of them are not actually real “step moms”, “step sisters”, “step dads” and “step brothers”, but it promotes to young people this kind of thing, which I think is a grievous sin towards God and his kingdom and something needs to change in the porn industry as a whole and in society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It promotes sin in terms of making young people lustful towards “porn actresses”, making them believe that things like adultery are normal in our society and of course they almost certainly are not. I guess because young people grow up in this environment where they watch these sinful acts which are promoted by the porn industry, and it encourages them to believe that this is completely acceptable and normal things like adultery and these really unusual and weird scenarios which just don’t happen in the real world with actual loving and caring couples who have lived together for decades who servants of God are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the solution is to make people recognize, especially young people and the porn industry itself the wrongdoings that they do and the effect that it has in our society, especially to young people and young adults such as myself who has watched such sinful acts and videos for so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I think that the solution to any issue in society is to first raise awareness to the general public and the people actually effected by it especially on why its so wrong and evil. The porn industry as a whole needs major reform and laws and regulations need to be put in place which stop the promotion of such sinful acts such as adultery and the young people that consume this kinds of content need to stop watching this content, but of course this is very difficult to do when its so heavily pushed this kind of content onto young people, therefore only until Governments start to act in accordance with God and start to actually take action to help young people across the globe stop watching these kinds of sinful content online is when we can start to see a shift in the mental health and wellbeing of young people in our society and instead promote normal and happy loving and caring families in our society, because what the porn industry as a whole promotes is extremely wrong and sinful and goes against the ten commandments, thou shall not lie (lying about them being “step moms”), thou shall not kill (“killing family life, killing happily married couples, killing what could have been happily married, loving caring couples), thou shall not steal (“stealing what could have been loving and caring couples), thou shall not serve any other God before me (“Serving dubious masters who don’t have societies best interests), thou shall honor your father and mother (promoting discontent with mother and father, through incest porn) thou shall not commit adultery (incest porn), Thou shall not make idols (promoting through masturbation worship to these sinful people in the industry as a whole), thou shall not covet (promoting lust to people). So, in total 8 of the 10 commandments are broken and it’s a grievous sin to break that many of the ten commandment and goes very much against God and his wishes for humanity. Hence why it’s important that young people are brought awareness to this issue and why it’s important that adults who should know better than young people do more about this, because in my eyes its an wrong the - whole industry in porn and the fact that Governments around the world are actually complacent in this, and only until we as individuals start to take to thing such as meditation, prayer and service to God can things begin to change in society as a whole and the porn industry can begin to change as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly I just wanted to add I’m not telling you to stop watching porn regardless of the title and the tone of the article, its just I wanted to encourage people to listen to my advice and spend more time considering exactly what they are watching and how it is very sinful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article I will be talking about forgiveness and forgiving someone that does wrong by you. First and foremost, forgiveness is a process and forgiveness brings a lot of atonement to your soul and helps to raise you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, let me just say that you shouldn’t keep forgiving someone when they keep constantly sinning against you and these kinds of people do not deserve forgiveness because they still believe in their hearts it’s the right thing to do and don’t show any level of respect for you and if you forgive them when they keep sinning against you then it shows that you don’t respect yourself. Therefore, forgiveness can sometimes begin by choosing not to forgive those who still believe in their hearts that sinning against you and God is the correct thing to do. There is a lot of power that forgiveness can bring to people and your enemies for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why you should forgive your enemies or strive to is because they don’t know which way they go, they are being lead astray, forgiveness also comes from recognizing that your enemies and sometimes your friends even don’t really know the deeper realities and the difficulties that you have faced in your life. Only God knows the absolute realities into all and so its important to show forgiveness to people whom you know better than when they sin because we are all equal and when you forgive another for their sin, you are able to be a true servant of God because the world should be filled with people who are more forgiving, loving, kind and generous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, forgiveness should be a show of strength because it takes some courage when someone has sinned a great deal in their life to be able to show that person forgiveness in what they do because you should recognize that we are all equal and even the most abject sinner in the world and the people who are truly evil in the world you are also capable of. Equally the great masters of the world such as Buddha, Jesus, Muhammad you believe it or not are capable of the same acts of those great masters. Hence why its important to be forgiving to those who sin when you realize that they sin because as Jesus once said, “Father forgive them for they do not know what they do”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, seek to forgive your greatest enemy and seek to understand why it is that they commit the sins that they commit and just recognize that they make up part of life as do you and seek to realize that the most evil people and evil groups in the world do and the great sins that they commit you also are capable of committing because we are all equal. Equally what Jesus was capable of with the various miracles that he did perform and is performing to this very day you are also capable of doing, because don’t believe for one second that Jesus doesn’t care for earth and is in heaven and is helping mankind on earth and sending his love to us each day. Its within you and only you are able to change yourself and become the best version of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Saint Christopher's Blog</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Stop Using Social Media</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/stop-using-social-media/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stop Using Social Media" /><published>2022-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-03-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/Stop-Using-Social-Media</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/stop-using-social-media/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/blogs/social/social.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Social media&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this short article I will be talking about why you should limit the time that you spend on social media platforms. Now in general most people need to admit to themselves that social media doesn’t really bring much benefit to them in their lives. Social media companies have designed algorithms which have been optimized to make the general public stay on social media for as long as possible to maximize their revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media in general also promotes a lot of negativity to the world and you have a lot of people doing terrible things on social media such as scamming, extortion, grooming, trolling, promoting hate, promoting racism, promoting gambling and all sorts of really negative things which contribute nothing but harm to our society and to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media also has a major impact on people’s mental health and makes people suffer because on Instagram and Snapchat when you always see your friends doing activities with others you feel lacking inside because you yourself are at home watching them enjoying life, so it promotes things like jealousy, hatred and negativity and doesn’t really promote any Christ like things such as peace, love and happiness, which is a shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the general public should limit the time they spend on social media platforms and ideally seek to remove it all together because it doesn’t help humanity and people’s own mental health which I think should be taken a lot more seriously in our society because social media in general actually promote mental illness by way of their algorithms which doesn’t benefit anyone long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, social media companies don’t have humanities best interests at heart because they censor certain opinions and ideas which hinder democracy and Governments around the world are complacent in that and its only until we as individuals start to stop using social media or at the very least limit the time in which we spend on these platforms because like I said it promotes things such as jealously and hurts our mental health. We should take to things such as meditation, prayer and service to God because it will lessen the power that evil has in the world and the evil that these social media companies bring to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, social media companies affect societies mental health, hurt our democracy, and do a lot of harm to the world and its only until we as individuals stop giving way to the temptation to constantly look at our phones every 5 minutes to look at Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube etc that we can begin to lessen the impact of the harm that these social media companies bring to the world. We as individuals should and need to take to things like meditation, prayer, and genuine service to God because it will bring a lot of benefit to the world and will further the power of God on earth. But if you feel that this is too much for you, then at the very least limit the time that you spend on social media, which will help your own mental health and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 1: 17/03/22&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to just add that, I am not telling you or forcing you to stop using social media regardless of the title. Its just I believe that our society needs to consider what they consume on a daily basis because its wrong in my eyes to spend all day on social media mindlessly consuming content. So really its moreso about the content in which you consume which is of importance.&lt;/p&gt;
