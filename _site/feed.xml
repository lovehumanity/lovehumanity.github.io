I guess the fact that I recognized that there was a problem was really significant in bringing me to the light so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess the thing that really did it was prayer. Prayer is what really brought me to the light, so if you feel lost as I did, then please do take to prayer because it will help you alot, feel free to give my article on prayer a read which gives you the technique that I generally use &lt;a href=&quot;/prayer/&quot;&gt;Prayer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Found at Sea&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I return from being lost at sea for oh so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look back and realize that my own ignorance, arrogance, and reluctance was preventing me from seeing the light of the lighthouse that was always there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now that I look back in sorrow at all the suffering that I put myself through in rowing endlessly attempting to find land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a sobering thought to think that the reason I caused myself so much suffering to myself is because I was so deluded that I thought that suffering was the answer to solve all my problems. It was not.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="life" /><summary type="html">This short poem is just a follow up from lost at sea made 19/01/22.

I felt I owe it to myself to share this short poem because people oft get the wrong idea about me that I have had an easy life through life and that because of my upbringing I have had a perfect life. Which therefore gives them the right to speak down to me thinkign that I haven’t gone through similar difficulties as they have. This simply isn’t true - you can have the most perfect upbringing in life, but still feel completely lost. This poem is of course a metaphor for life where I was in such a deep state of sloth and torpor and would just “goto sleep” as I described it at time. I will also post my very short poem on being found at sea - which I think is quite cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess what the poem really kinda illistrates is that there is a purpose to life and that sometimes your perceptions of life, your way of looking at things and your way of living can have a major impact on your wellbeing and mental health. What this poem really is about is not giving up because all too often I find that people give up easily on things and that if people put more efforts into changing their beliefs and their perceptions that they can change their reality and who they want to be in life. But only you can choose who you want to be in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I begin the poem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rowing and rowing endlessly at sea looking for land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I ever find land?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long have I been rowing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Endlessly it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I see others rowing in their boats looking for land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are as lost as me, some act like they are not lost and that seems to fool some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone is lost at sea rowing endlessly looking for land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will they ever find land?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long have these others been rowing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more than others it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I hallucinate and think I have found land after all my searching and all the vast efforts I have put into rowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The joy I feel in thinking I have found land doesn’t last very long as I get closer and closer and realize it was just a hallucination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have those from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the stars give me warning signs that there are pirates or sharks further ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is dying any much worse than rowing endlessly lost at sea in the hopes that I will one day find land?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I oft envy the stars with their vantage point; they seem to know so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do they have sympathy for me being lost at sea?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are they the reason I’m lost at sea in a boat rowing endlessly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are special boats that pick-up people that for whatever reason stop rowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that special boat they tell that person why it’s so important to keep rowing endlessly at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know who the crazy one is to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I dream of being older and being even more lost at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will there ever be a point in my life when I am not lost at sea?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I see couples share their boats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the result is the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Endless rowing lost at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s better that they are lost at sea with each other, at least they can provide each other comfort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes there are items in the sea that I pick up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They give me entertainment for some time, but I know deep down that the entertainment they give me is only due to how benign rowing lost at sea is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I ask myself is there any point in continuing? Afterall, I have been rowing endlessly at sea my whole life and yet I still hold on to some hope that maybe one day I will be able to find land and live there instead of rowing endlessly at sea. Maybe I’m deluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should ignore the warnings from the stars and let the pirates and sharks have me, at least then maybe it will stop me from rowing endlessly lost at sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who put this ocean here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why was I given a boat and paddle to row?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why could I have not started at land to begin with?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that one day I can find land.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="life" /><summary type="html">I thought I would share here this poem I wrote in December 2021 to share here that in life it hasn’t always been easy sailing so to speak.

The second noble truth is that dukka has a cause and that cause is a thirst, craving, wanting or as I put it desire. Essentially what this means it that dukka inevitably has a cause which the Buddha saw as wanting/thirst/trying to get the object of desire into our hands. This wanting/thirst/trying/desire arises from within us (which I agree with).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wanting comes in three different forms. The first is sensual desire. We want comfort, physical sensations – nice food, a healthy body. We also want good intellectual stimulation, good conversation, a balanced and emotional life, enjoyable art and entertainment, we want to listen to good music, we want massages, we want to see nice photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second form of craving is for existence itself. We don’t want to die and what we envision death to be or I have envisioned death to be is nothingness (and has caused me to be in a total state of sloth and torpor) We would much rather live and persistent and live until 1000 years old. I guess its more so the unknowable and uncertainty of what happens when our physical body ceases to function. But something which has helped me is to realize that we are not our physical bodies. The brain and heart are just computers in a way because they keep the body alive. We are not our physical bodies so we should not identify with our physical body, which is something that I have suffered with tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third and last form of craving/want/thirst/desire is that for non-existence. That is we don’t want to be unhappy, we don’t want to be miserable etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess what the second noble truth really is about is realizing that dukka has a cause and that cause is thirst/desire/wanting/craving and this arises only from within us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><category term="Buddhism" /><summary type="html">In this short article I will talk a little about my understanding of the second noble truth in Buddhism.

I will just say now that love is the strongest force in the universe and love is what gives us strength in this world and also should be the force that guides us in terms of we should always strive to take the actions that will bring the most love to the world, not just for yourself but for all of life, because you are not the only person living on the planet and should be respectful not just to yourself, but to all of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will also add here that similar to what Jesus once said with when having to one of two actions, where both is an evil in a sense – do the action that is the lesser of two evils. Well, I put here today that when you are faced with one of two choices, you should take the choice that will bring the most love not just to yourself but to others as well. Or as I describe it doing the most loving thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, love should be the guiding force in the world and we should all strive to be more loving towards others, especially ourselves and follow Jesus’s teaching of “loving thy neighbor as ourselves”, because with this simply principal if everyone applied it to their lives then the world would be a much more beautiful place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly you shouldn’t just love your neighbors you should love your enemies also because if you only love your friends and ‘neighbors’ then where is the room to loving those who do you harm? Also something that I am trying to understand more is that you don’t beat evil by being evil yourself – or fighting fire with fire just simply doesn’t work, and I am yet to fully understand that. The only thing that beats evil is the power of God, which comes through things like love, peace, happiness, joy or praying for others evil and meditating on things like love and peace etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To wrap up, seek to be more loving to one another and seek to when faced with one or more decisions in life – seek to take the decision which will bring not just the most love to yourself, but bring the most love to others as well. Also when you see evil seek to pray for that person’s evil and just send out your love to that person as best as you can – feel free to give my articles on &lt;a href=&quot;/prayer/&quot;&gt;Prayer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;/meditation/&quot;&gt;Meditation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/pray-for-your-enemies/&quot;&gt;Praying For Your Enemies&lt;/a&gt; a read which will give you some good guidance on how to pray and meditate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><category term="Jesus" /><category term="God" /><category term="Christianity" /><category term="Love" /><category term="Love thy neighbour" /><category term="Prayer" /><category term="Meditationg" /><category term="Enemies" /><category term="Evil" /><summary type="html">In this short article I will talk a little about love and doing the most loving thing.

Right speech encompasses anything you say to others and yourself, even with talking in your mind you should practice right speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key thing in right speech is to not tell lies to anybody, but you don’t need to tell everyone your whole life, but just have speech which is consistent with the truth as you know it to be, and which is relevant to the discussion at hand. The reason this causes suffering is because you need to constantly keep track of what you have told people all the time in order to be organized with yourself, and so if you are always lying then it will cause much suffering to yourself in keeping track of what you have and haven’t told others because it causes you suffering in the sense that you just are not organized and it can be a bit much on yourself keeping track on who you have told what to whom. It also hinders your soul because when you don’t tell people the truth as you know it to be then it brings death to the soul, but also it hurts others which brings death to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another aspect of right speech is talking at the correct time when it is your time to speak during conversations - which is something that I cannot really read, I guess for me it’s due to confidence in a way and feeling like I am a bad person in doing this, which is just silly really, but also I speak out of turn a lot because my own personality and ego gets in the way and also my anxiety can also take control over me. It’s also about having relevant conversations to the correct people at the right time and realizing when the correct time for discussion on xyz is. For example, you shouldn’t disturb someone who is sleeping to talk about moving from your house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right speech is also about avoiding idle talk, gossip and speaking ill of others, because essentially it causes others suffering if they find out about you talking ill about them, but it causes yourself suffering in the sense that its low vibrational level talk which hinders your soul (for me at least) and is mostly just piety to talk about these kinds of things, because its zero sum – in the sense that you don’t really get much and the other party doesn’t really get much from it either – except fulfilling their own egos. Its also about showing others respect for all their idiosyncrasy, faults and characters by avoiding talking ill of them and avoiding lying to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A further aspect of Right Speech is knowing when to be silent during conversation – even if someone asks you a question directly to you because it adds to the conversation even not answering someone’s question. But of course, this isn’t an excuse to not talk to people during conversation but is another aspect of right speech which I thought I would mention here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right speech is also about using the correct use of your language (whichever language that you speak in) and ensuring that you can present yourself in a way that you would like to be presented to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its also about not hurting others through your words - which I think is quite important because it brings death to the soul, but also hurts the other person. There is a time and place for every conversation and some things are better left unsaid sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly the final aspect of right speech is having healthy, good, meaningful conversations to others about things which are of importance to either them or yourself and also having the appropriate body language – tone of voice – energy level during conversation. This causes suffering to yourself because you should come across in conversation in saying what you mean and tone of voice, body language and energy level is what matters if you don’t then it undermines yourself and brings death to the soul because you are not able to come across and present to the world what you mean – which causes suffering and causes others to misconstrue. In other words, say what you mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me its also about control – because I feel that by not being 100% truthful it will free me from suffering because I feel that others cause me suffering in how they judge me (or how I perceive they will judge me), but really, I cause myself suffering by not adhering to the eightfold path as best as I can. Which also plays into this fault I have that you need to fight fire with fire. Its just difficult for me to really accept this, I guess. I also need to understand more why there is nothing is permanent, and everything is in constant change. But then again what’s the worst judgement someone can really make about me – and who are they to make that judgement upon me? The only judgement I should give is to myself and I should judge myself fairly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, right speech is not lying to others, having good conversations with people using the correct body language and tone of voice, speaking to others at the correct times in conversations. But its also about ensuring that you avoid from idle talk, gossip and speaking ill of others (even in your own mind and in a way plays a lot into judging others which is something that everyone should strive to do because it causes others suffering how others are judged – which isn’t good). Its also about saying what you mean and believing in what you say because its important to do that to free yourself from suffering.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><category term="Buddhism" /><category term="Right Speech" /><category term="Noble EightFoldPath" /><category term="Noble Four Truths" /><summary type="html">In this short article I will talk about right speech which is one of the eightfold paths.

It means unsatisfactory, I think what the Buddha really meant by this word is that because everything is temporary, we are not able to satisfy anything into a permanent state and because of this we suffer and that it is unavoidable due to there being existence – this is just one aspect of dukka that the Buddha meant and I think one of the more important aspects of dukka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first kind of dukka is pain, both physical and mental pain – whether we like it or not, pain is an unavoidable part of our lives. Many cases to avoid pain actually increases it as with the case of a toothache that is put of for a few months and then when going to the dentist you experience more pain from having to have the tooth removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second form of dukka is change we suffer because we think that our unhappiness, doubts, worries and negative emotions are permanent states and define who we are. But we should always appreciate this basic notion that nothing is permanent – everything is in everlasting change because anything that is made up of something (and everything is made up of parts) it is subject to change because those parts are inevitably broken down or built up into other things which make up a whole. This is because in existence everything is made from parts. Even the most basic thing an atom goes into making something and so when atoms make up wood – can you really call all those atoms wood? Or can you call wood just a bunch of atoms? Labels for different interdependent parts seems to define existence in a way. I guess the point I’m making is that because things are made from interdependent parts, they will always be subject to change because they are either broken down or reused and turned into something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is thus what defines existence, the fact that all things are essentially just made up of other smaller things and due to this its law that because everything is made up of interdependent parts they will either decay and be broken down or they will be put to use and turned into something else (as is the case with atoms) and so nothing is complete in of itself because nothing can be unconditioned in terms of being free from the parts that make it and being free of being able to be built into something. Therefore because of this basic principle everything that will ever exist and can possibly exist is bound by the law of change. Or as the Buddha put it everything is impermanent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third and final form of dukka is one which requires serious contemplation and that is that if your existence if in being, then you must inevitably pass out of existence. This is something which I still don’t fully actually understand to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always put my words to the test and see the truth for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><category term="Buddhism" /><summary type="html">The first noble truth is that the existence is inevitably dukka or usually this is translated as suffering but that doesn’t encompass the entire meaning of this word.

I don’t know much about Ukraine and the politics involved in that area, but I know that all war isn’t good. I don’t actually watch the news, but I have heard from the forums and friends/family that I visit that the situation is dire in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did see Russian forces from YouTube enter Ukraine and heard that the people were confusing the Russians by mixing the street signs. My thoughts are with those who are affected by this terrible crisis in Ukraine, and I wish all from Ukraine who read this message safety and good health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I have decided to take a stand against this, and I will be praying for Ukraine that the war be stopped, and the suffering and chaos be put to an end there because I stand for peace and love and not war and chaos as should we all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, I encourage all who read this short article to take up prayer and also meditation and after each meditation session to send out your loving/peaceful thoughts out to Ukraine. Of course, those who are able to – perhaps you could further support Ukraine by funding noble causes which help the people of Ukraine in some way and engaging in debates and lobbying our Government to take action against this crisis in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course the issue of Ukraine all comes down to politics in some way or another. So seek to pray that these politicians that we have in power are brought to the light so to speak because whether we like it or not our polticitians and world leaders are corrupt and not good people. The best thing that we can do as people is pray for these people that currently hold positions of power in the world. Politics is a subject I tend to avoid because it devides people alot, but we as people should recongize that the leaders we currently have don’t have our best interests at heard, therefore we should use the power of prayer to reduce the suffering that these people that we currently in power cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is on each and everyone of us and our responsibility as people to pray for these people in power because like I said they don’t have our best interests at heart. But we as people should be consistent with prayer and setup a regular practice of prayer as our daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to give my article on prayer a read, linked &lt;a href=&quot;/prayer/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;, which also gives the prayer which I have made, which may be of use to you who read this message and also give my article on meditation a read, linked &lt;a href=&quot;/meditation/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;, on the technique which I have used for over 3 and a half years now which has helped me significantly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Current Affairs" /><summary type="html">Hello all, it saddens me to see war in Ukraine.

I define fake spirituality is spirituality which is just fake and not true to yourself. As the Buddha once said, “see the truth in my words for yourself”. So essentially what it can mean is that you don’t see the truth for yourself, but act like you see the truth. Also, a side note I see the truth in various things – but fail to accept it. Which is something that I don’t fully understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another point I wanted to add is that people identify with being ‘spiritual’… what does that even mean? There is nothing wrong with that, but I think it hinders your ability to make actual spiritual progress because with identifying as being spiritual it could encourage you to share this with others and so ‘virtue signal’ – which isn’t right because the spiritual path should be trod in secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing which I think is important to ensuring that you don’t practice ‘fake spirituality’ is to become more like a child, feel free to read my article on this &lt;a href=&quot;/becoming-a-child/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; another thing which I think is important to not practicing ‘fake spirituality’ is to offer your service to the world through a job which doesn’t harm others (i.e gun seller in America) but also to meditate/pray and also to not lie to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key aspect of it is also to take the saw dust out of your own eyes before you go around helping others in their ways, feel free to give my article on this &lt;a href=&quot;/taking-the-saw-dust-out-of-your-own-eyes/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;, because you should help yourself before you go around helping others. Everyone is far from perfect and so everyone should work on themselves because everyone has flaws in some way – this could be personality flaws, bad habits, flaws picked up from others in their lives etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly just do things which are true to yourself and don’t feel the need to follow the crowd at all. Especially if you feel that the crowd is wrong in what they do. Do things true to yourself, and not others. Only you can decide what it means to be [your name]. Nobody can decide that for you. Only you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">I wanted to talk a little about ‘fake spirituality’ which is something I have been a victim of for various points in my life. I define fake spirituality is spirituality which is just fake and not true to yourself. As the Buddha once said, “see the truth in my words for yourself”. So essentially what it can mean is that you don’t see the truth for yourself, but act like you see the truth. Also, a side note I see the truth in various things – but fail to accept it.

Link to original article is &lt;a href=&quot;https://thegreatwhitebrotherhood.org/lessons/possession/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; link to their website is &lt;a href=&quot;https://thegreatwhitebrotherhood.org/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to put here a technique that you can do to get rid of any bad spirit that may be attached to you. It will also protect you.. It is simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sit on your own in a room with the door and window closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell God that you are going to pray to get rid of a bad spirit and ask Him to send His angels and your guides to stand guard over you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then imagine that you are sitting under a shower of water that is pouring over your head, over your body and down into the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be spiritual “water” but try really to feel it as if you were under a real shower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sit under this shower of spiritual water for a couple of minutes and visualize all negative entities being washed away from you and down into the ground just as if you were dirty and were washing the dirt from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine this spiritual water not only washing your body but washing you inside also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a couple of minutes, let the spiritual water stop, thank God for the fact that all bad spirits have now gone, thank God for the protection that he sent you and just carry on with your day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may do this for three days consecutively, if you wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any bad spirit will now be gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number 2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, how to protect your house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buy a small bag of rock salt – real salt not this man made stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put it outside your house where the sun shines. Leave it there for three days so that the daylight fills the salt with positive energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, ask God to bless the salt – just ask God as if you were talking to a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, go round your house/apartment and, everywhere where there is an opening – doors, windows, fireplaces, toilets, wash basins, taps (faucets), say a little prayer to God thanking Him for His protection and sprinkle a little of the salt in the sign of a cross over those openings. You can also sprinkle a little salt in a line across the threshold of the doors and windows. Go round your entire place doing that. Then, when you have finished, thank God for his protection and you are finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a garden (yard) you can also go round the limit of your area sprinkling a little salt and thanking God for His protection. Once again, when you are finished, thank God for his protection and you are finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No demon can now enter your house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number 3:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you lie down to sleep, say a short prayer to God thanking Him for sending His angels to look after you when you sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will draw angels to you who will remain in the astral realms protecting you as you sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then imagine that you are like an embryo chick. Imagine a white eggshell completely surrounding you as you sleep with you safe in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This eggshell will be real in the etheric realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you have angels protecting you in the astral realms and you are protected from the etheric realm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing can harm you and nothing can enter your space. Also, you can not leave that space as the eggshell is keeping you safe inside it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, sleep peacefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you wake up in the morning, thank God for sending His angels to keep you safe all night, imagine the eggshell dissolving and just carry on with your day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, do not go to bed having taken drugs or strong drink.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">I don’t take credit for the techniques outlined here - they come from The Great White Brotherhood.

The secret with prayer is to have the genuine intention of helping the person/thing you are praying and doing it for them and not for yourself. To progress towards God, it’s important to serve your fellow man, meditate and pray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When praying for others, you draw towards you Gods’ helpers/guides/angels etc. who will help you with your needs and help you to progress towards God. So, helping others through service and prayer is almost definitely in everyone’s best interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technique that I use to pray nowadays is to sit and visualize the person/thing that is causing harm to the world and send out a prayer that this person/thing is helped by God but doing so in a manner without any ill intent towards the person/thing you are praying for but doing so in the genuine intention that this person is helped by God for his benefit and not your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another technique which has helped me along my journey, and I think which will help others is to use Jesus’s prayer which is a really good prayer called the “Lords prayer” which you can find a copy of it somewhere on the internet, but it goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our Father who art in heaven,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hallowed by thy name,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thy Kingdom come,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thy will be done,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On earth as it is in heaven,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give us this day our daily bread,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lead us not into temptation,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But deliver us from evil,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Power and the Glory is yours, now and forever and ever,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amen”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, I say this prayer a few times (but leave the amen until the end) and say it with conviction and trueness in your heart. Over time you will be able to take up regular prayer and draw towards you Gods angels/guides who will work alongside you to help for your benefit and the benefit of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to also give my article a read which is similar to this one &lt;a href=&quot;https://lovehumanity.gitlab.io/spiritual/Pray-For-Your-Enemies/&quot;&gt;Pray for your Enemies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 1: 02/03/22&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also made my own prayer if anyone is interested in my prayer feel fre to use it as a template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said with conviction and sincerity and a belief in the power of God and with an understanding and trueness in the meanings of the words. Be sincere and actually act like you art thanking God directly when saying this prayer for the ‘magic’ to work. Generally I repeat this prayer for half an hour and it will and has done wonders for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our Father who art in heaven,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hallowed be your name,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I Thank you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all the blessings that you send to us on earth,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For helping those in need,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping us away from evil and corruption,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For helping those who are seduced by evil and corruption,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading us not into temptation,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But leading us to become more Christ like,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing peace, love, harmony and order to the world,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving us the strength, dignity, fortitude, bravery and courage to fulfill your will for each of us,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helping us to serve you and only you,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helping those will ill will in their hearts to change for the benefit of life,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helping those who don’t yet believe in your power,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And giving us freedom and leading us to you,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amen”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><category term="Jesus" /><category term="God" /><category term="Christianity" /><summary type="html">Praying is one of the things that I think a lot of people can benefit from.
