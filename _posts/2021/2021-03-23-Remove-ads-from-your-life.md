In this short post I will lay out some things you can do to remove ads from your life. This post is in no way definitive and only a few ways will be explored. I am very much against ads hence why I'm making this post.


## Install an ad-blocker in your browser 

This one is key because most ads nowadays are served on the web. Google Chrome and Firefox allow you to install ad blockers the one I recommend is Ublock-Origin by Raymond Hill which is free and open source meaning that you can read the source code yourself and change it if you doso desire

Chrome [link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)

Firefox [link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)

This will remove the vast majority of the ads you see on the web including ads on youtube videos

## Use 3rd party apps on your phone

You can consider downloading the alternative youtube app on android called newpipe which can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases/tag/v0.20.11)

If you use Reddit you can also use the app 'slide' available on the [f-droid](https://f-droid.org/) app store which will remove all the ads

## Pause/mute tv when ads are playing

This one is common sense if you have tevo pause the tv until the ads finish if you don't have tevo mute the tv
