I"–<p>I define self respect as accepting who you are, seeing your accomplishments, strengths, weaknesses and flaws and accepting that this is who you are with no feeling of a need to change yourself in this regard. Its also about how you view yourself, feel free to check out my article on (self-image) its a habbit I see in people where they think its the right thing to downplay their own value to the world.</p>

<p>Seeing your accomplishments is a big part of what self-respect is. Accomplishments can be anything that you worked hard to achieve, an example in my case is earning my OSCP, which took many months, but its over and finished.</p>

<p>Another part of self-respect is not pushing yourself down by talking ill of yourself or doing things that are detrimental to yourself. Show yourself the self-respect that you deserve, for if you donâ€™t respect yourself then how can you expect others to give you respect? Its also about suffering, you should respect yourself enough to not allow yourself to suffer unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t listen to people that donâ€™t give you respect, avoid such people, you should have enough self-respect that you are able to ignore people that donâ€™t give any respect towards you. Avoid spending time with others that donâ€™t give respect, but look to understand why they donâ€™t respect you and see if you agree with their reasoning.</p>

<p>In conclusion self-respect isnâ€™t something many people consider, but it should be considered because without it your image of yourself is an unhealthy one. Donâ€™t get into the bad habbit of thinking you are worthless, everyone is equal and everyone has the same capacity to achieve success.</p>
