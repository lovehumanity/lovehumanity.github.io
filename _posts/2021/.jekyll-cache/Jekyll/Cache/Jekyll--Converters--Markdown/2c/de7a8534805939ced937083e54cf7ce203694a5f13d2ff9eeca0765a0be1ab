<p>There is a stigma around mental health, because we like to think our mental health is all good, but let me just say that in my <a href="https://lovehumanity.gitlab.io/wellbeing/spiritual/Mental-Wellbeing/">mental wellbeing</a> article I said that everyone experiences mental health in their own way. Which is true. Some people hide it better than others though.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s not to say that me the person who has been putting out so many wellbeing articles havenâ€™t experienced mental health difficulty myself. When I was 17 I was diagnosed with psychosis, and its only until now that I have started to take it more seriously. I thought that I â€˜knew betterâ€™ than the doctors and nurses and in some cases I do, but others I donâ€™t. Also its about control. You feel your in the drivers seat and donâ€™t recognise when psychosis is actually in the driving seat so to speak.</p>

<p>The number one thing with mental health is admitting to yourself that you have a problem, this could be recognising that you have depression, recognising that you are unwell and need help. Donâ€™t be ashamed to seek help if you need it. Know that there are many like you who have gone through similar things in life.</p>

<p>One thing I will say though is that mental health hospitals can be a form of control. But it backfires because you still benefit from that means of control because you still get help. Antohrr thing I will say though is that some hospitals can be detremental, there are some nurses who are sadly sadistic and so enjoy watching you suffer at their hands. But donâ€™t let that deter you from getting the help that you need.</p>

<p>Also you should see mental health as a normal part of life. Generally people that stigmatise mental health have their own problems which they refuse to admit to themselves and hide it from themselves and others to their own detriment.</p>

<p>I will finish off by saying that the reason I think there is stigma around mental health is because its a threat to others reality. People donâ€™t like threats to their reality and so do everything in their power to get rid of people who threaten that. People also have egos which owes itself an article onto itself and plays into ego. But if you get sectioned here in the UK, donâ€™t be down on yourself, just see it as just a learning curve in your life. I learned more about myself by being sectioned than I would have very known had I not been.</p>

<p>Mental health is also no joke. Its can be a serious health condition for some and a mild condition for others. If you experience it donâ€™t make the mistake of thinking you are insane. You are as sane as everyone else on this earth, but you are one of the lucky ones :wink:</p>
