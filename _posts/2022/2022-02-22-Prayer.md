# My Prayer

I made my own prayer if anyone is interested in my prayer feel free to use it as a template.

Said with conviction and sincerity and a belief in the power of God and with an understanding and trueness in the meanings of the words. Be sincere and actually act like you are thanking God directly when saying this prayer for the 'magic' to work and show respect to God and his helpers who answer your prayer. Generally I repeat this prayer for 15 minutes daily and it will and has done wonders for me and for the world. A short note is that the reason we say "Our Father" is because we are all children of God because nobody is perfect. 

"Our Father who art in heaven,

Hallowed be your name,

I Thank you 

For all the blessings that you send to us on earth,

Helping those in need,

Helping mankind to be true to themselves,

Keeping us away from evil and corruption, 

Helping those who are seduced by evil and corruption,

Leading us not into temptation,

Forgiving us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us,

Giving us the strength to fulfill your will for each of us,

Helping us to be able serve you and only you,

Helping those who don't yet believe in your power,

Helping those whom suffer without good cause,

And I thank you for giving us freedom and leading us to you,

Amen"

Praying is one of the things that I think a lot of people can benefit from. The secret with prayer is to have the genuine intention of helping the person/thing you are praying and doing it for them and not for yourself. To progress towards God, it’s important to serve your fellow man, meditate and pray. 

When praying for others, you draw towards you Gods’ helpers/guides/angels etc. who will help you with your needs and help you to progress towards God. So, helping others through service and prayer is almost definitely in everyone’s best interest.

One technique that I have used to pray which I got From the Stairway to Freedom and you can find a link to this book [Here](https://thegreatwhitebrotherhood.org/books/) is to sit and visualize the person/thing that is causing harm to the world and send out a prayer that this person/thing is helped by God but doing so in a manner without any ill intent towards the person/thing you are praying for but doing so in the genuine intention that this person is helped by God for his benefit and not your own.

Over time you will be able to take up regular prayer and draw towards you Gods angels/guides who will work alongside you to help for your benefit and the benefit of the world.

Of course prayer is very important in making progress towards God and growing in spirituality and so its important for everyone on the spiritual path to take up prayer and meditation and for it to become apart of daily routine, because through these things and service to man you can begin to lessen your own ego and have that be replaced with spiritual power. Of course my article can only help you if you put into action these words you have read here. So please do take up prayer and have it be apart of your daily routine, just 15 minutes a day will change your life for the better and generally I pray using my prayer and I repeat it 15 minutes daily in a quiet place, but of course if you would like you can go longer in prayer - but just consider the fact that others and yourself will need to put actions in order to have that prayer be answered.
