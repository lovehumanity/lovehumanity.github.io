Meditation, prayer and service to man is of vital importance in making real progress towards God. I will talk a little about meditation and give you my basic technique which I have used for a few years now, which I have got from the Great White Brotherhood. If you would like to know why meditation is so important feel free to read The Great White Brotherhood's article on the subject, in short you become a more devleoped human being - you develop your auras and allow your chakras to open up more and allow energy to pass more freely into them, you are also able to develop the gifts of the spirit over many years. The gifts of the spirit are telepathy, telekenesis, clairvoyance, clairsentience and teleportation. But you shouldn't meditate with the goal of devloping the gifts - meditate with the intent on meditating and over time the gifts will appear.

Firstly when you start meditating its best to choose a quiet place where you can not be disturbed by others and where there is little outside noise and distractions.

Secondly you should say a short prayer thanking God for his protection and thanking Angels and your guides for watching over you as you meditate.

Thirdly you should visualise yourself using your hands placing a cacoon over yourself. 

After you do these things then you should sit quietly ideally in a chair or a place of your choosing and then try to clear yourself of your thoughts as best as you can for about 15 minutes. Consistency is key with anything in life as with meditation, so you shouldn't over exert yourself and spend longer in meditation than you need to.

After you have finished 15 minutes of meditation, then you should send this energy which you have received from God out to the world - just imagine yourself sending out this energy is all you need do. Then thank Gods angels and your guides for watching over you and then imagine yourself lowering this cacoon that you had placed over you.

Aim to make meditation apart of your daily routine and you can meditate for longer and as frequnetly as you wish, but aim to be consistent.

Great implying nobility, White implying purity of intentions and Brotherhood meaning a collective. Most people generally mistake this group for being a white supremacy group due to the name but having followed their teachings for a number of years I can attest to their authenticity and they are serious in their intention of spreading various spiritual teachings to the world and spreading the truths of the world.
