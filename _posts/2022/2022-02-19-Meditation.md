# Why Meditate?

Meditation, prayer and service to man is of vital importance in making real progress towards God. I will talk a little about meditation and give you my basic technique which I have used for a few years now, which I have got from an esoteric group which I will talk about later in this article. The benefits of meditation are you become a more devleoped human being - you develop your auras and allow your chakras to open up more and allow energy to pass more freely into them, you are also able to develop the gifts of the spirit by consitently meditating for a prolonged period of time. The gifts of the spirit are telepathy (talking with others with your mind), telekenesis (moving objects with your mind), clairvoyance (Seeing into the spiritual realms), clairsentience (Feeling through your spiritual senses) and teleportation (Moving from one place to another). But you shouldn't meditate with the goal of devoloping the gifts - meditate with the intent on meditating and over time the gifts will appear, but don't be deterred from the practice if they don't come to you when you would like. God grants the gifts and he also can remove the gifts if they are not used for helping your fellow man. The gifts also shouldn't be used for fulfilling your own ego.

Now for the technique on how to meditate correctly (and no its not finding a pool to meditate as the image may suggest)

# Meditation Technique 

Firstly when you start meditating its best to choose a quiet place where you can not be disturbed by others and where there is little outside noise and distractions.

Secondly you should say a short prayer thanking God for his protection and thanking Angels and your guides for watching over you as you meditate.

Thirdly you should visualise yourself using your hands placing a cocoon over yourself. 

After you do these things then you should sit quietly ideally in a chair or a place of your choosing and then try to clear yourself of your thoughts as best as you can for about 15 minutes. Consistency is key with anything in life as with meditation, so you shouldn't over exert yourself and spend longer in meditation than you need to.

After you have finished 15 minutes of meditation, then you should send this energy which you have received from God out to the world - just imagine yourself sending out this energy is all you need do. Then thank Gods angels and your guides for watching over you and then imagine yourself lowering this cocoon that you had placed over you.

This is roughly what I have been taught on the correct way to meditate.

# More on Meditation

Aim to make meditation apart of your daily routine and you can meditate for longer and as frequnetly as you wish, but aim to be consistent. I will say that I have been meditating fairly consistently for close to 4 years now and I will say that it has allowed me to focus a lot better in my tasks, allowed me to notice reoccuring thought patterns, allowed me to experience bliss, given me a fair amount of enlightnment into myself and has made me alot more peaceful and less egotistical.
