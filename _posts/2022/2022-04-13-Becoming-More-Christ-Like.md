First and foremost, with becoming more Christ it’s important to practice Meditation/Prayer and some means of service to God which you enjoy. Only with this are you able to understand yourself a little bit better and work on your flaws. Through these things you are able to incorporate more levels of Christ like emotions into you. 

The first thing with Christ like emotions and giving them out to others and yourself is to recognise that you need to have good intentions with giving them to the world and have no desires in doing so. Any ill will towards the recipient will cause the Christ like emotion to not be accepted.

The next thing that you should understand is that you need to recognise what happens when there are no Christ like emotions in the world, things like fear, hatred, anger, ugliness, dirtiness, sadistic behaviors, betrayal, jealously, greed, envy, confusion, war, lust, non-acceptance, non-respect, non-understanding, etc and see what kind of world that this produces if everyone only gives way to the Anti-Christ emotions.

When you are able to see what kind of world this really produces then you are able to understand a little bit better why its so important for each and everyone to become more Christ like in their ways and this only comes, I believe in understanding and appreciating what kind of world the Anti-Christ emotions bring. So, for you to really become more Christ like you need to first gain some understanding of the wrongness in the Anti-Christ emotions and this comes in doses I believe, as in to the extend that you are loving is the extend to some degree you have seen hatred, but more importantly the wrongness in hatred and the wrongness in all the other Anti-Christ emotions.

But for me, I often use the analogy of what does an ideal world look like? Does an ideal world look like groups of people fighting over one thing because they are jealous of each other? Does an ideal world look like men or women longing for each other giving way to lust? Does an ideal world look like each person giving way to greed, counting the amount of money they have in their bank account and not sharing it to others or using it for the good of others? Point here being is that an ideal world does mean having more and more people becoming more Christ like, becoming more loving, peaceful, forgiving, happy accepting of one another, respectful to one another, understanding to one another, sharing to one another, being more grateful for what they already have, rather than giving way to things such as jealousy and envy.

Hence my general advice when seeking to become more Christ like is to look at what the opposite does and what that brings, and then seek to find solace in Christ like emotions and seek to picture what an ideal world looks like and seek to apply this to yourself, seeking to rid yourself day by day of the anti-Christ emotions because in my eyes that is what an ideal world looks like. More and more people becoming more Christ like in their ways and becoming more loving to one another. 

When seeking to rid yourself of Anti-Christ emotions such as hatred, seek to understand yourself a little better as to why you give way to hatred, perhaps its things from your past which is holding you down and dragging you down spirituality and emotionally which hasn’t yet been addressed yet, or past traumas which haven’t been resolved yet, or relationship issues which you have had in the past which didn’t work out and have left you feeling low and depressed because of it. Or perhaps is the things which you watch on TV which has you in such a negative state its difficult for more positive Christ like things such as love to come through to you. 

Therefore, seek to resolve the issues you have had with your partner, or friends and family and seek to build stronger long-lasting relationships with them and instead of burying things under the carpet relationship wise, seek to address them by talking about them honestly and sincerely, rather than hiding it from each other the issues that you really face and burying it under things. But its also about yourself, you shouldn’t hide things from yourself and bury things under the carpet from yourself, but seek to address them as best as you can, instead of avoiding them all the time, because the consequences of avoiding past traumas and past issues that you faced and leaving them unresolved leaves a buildup of tension on your wellbeing and a buildup of tension on your spirituality and emotions and has an impact on how you treat others and yourself. But it’s important to put yourself first, and then others.

Its also very important to show only Christ like emotions who those you believe are deserving of it because not everyone is deserving of respect, forgiveness, understanding because it should be your own judgement if someone is deserving of respect, forgiveness and understanding and all the other Christ like emotions and we all express these Christ like emotions in our own ways and its only those who are advanced spiritualy to be able to see if someone is deserving of these Christ like emotions, because those lower down on the spiritual ladder shouldn't forgive those who are higher up because in part it plays into realities and those on a more spiritualy advanced level know of deeper realities than those lower down, because there is no way for you to know the deeper realities of those who work on higher spiritual planes.

Its also the levels of Christ like emotions which are important, because you shouldn't give way to all your ability to forgive on a simple thing such as pushing someone or bumping into someone, its the level of atonement needed which is important when forgiving someone and recongzing that the person has all their flaws and I and others are far from perfect.
