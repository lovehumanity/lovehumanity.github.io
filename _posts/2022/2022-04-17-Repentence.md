In this article I will talk a little bit about repentance, and repentance first comes in recognizing your wrongdoing and the harm that you caused to others and yourself.

Repentance must first come in being honest to yourself and being true to yourself and for you to recognise the reality of things and seeing the reality in how you harmed yourself and others and the effects that this has had on the world and how this affects yourself. But you should seek to understand yourself more in why you took those actions and see that you did so without recognizing the reality of things.

A large part of repentance is atonement, and you bring light to yourself in being repentant of your sins. But you should recognise that when you repent your sins it lifts a lot of the time a heavy burden on your soul which weighs you down spiritually and emotionally.

Therefore, my advice is to repent your sins early or as soon as you are able to because the weight that this takes on your soul weights you down a lot and brings darkness to yourself and your life.

Therefore, if someone does wrong unto you, it doesn’t give you the right to take pity revenge and so you should seek to repent your wrongdoing that you caused to others, because when someone does wrong to you – that doesn’t give you any right to take it out on them and others and especially not yourself.

So, my advice, would be to repent before you return to heaven your sins because what reward shall you have for your life once you live for eternity in peace and love in heaven? Therefore, when you recognise your wrongdoing, seek to repent your sins as early as possible, for the rewards you shall receive in heaven are big.

Denying the reality of your situation and denying yourself to repent your sins brings to yourself darkness spiritually and emotionally.
