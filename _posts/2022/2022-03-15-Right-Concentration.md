In this short article I will be talking about Right Concentration. Which is one element of the eightfold path and one which I think if mastered will be very beneficial to all.

The first part in understanding right concentration or any element of the eightfold path is to understand why this makes us suffer. You first need to understand why not having Right Concentration at the right times and at the appropriate settings causes suffering. To me Right means giving way to concentration at the right times and when appropriate. But the key thing with all the elements of the eightfold path is to realize and appreciate why not having them leads to suffering, which I think is key in understanding and following Buddhism and the philosophy behind it.

Right concentration is heavily linked to right mindfulness because with right mindfulness you are able to appreciate as and when you are not concentrating on the task at hand and when you drift off so to speak. But like I said you need to understand why not having any one of the elements of the eightfold path actually leads to suffering, before you are able to fully appreciate why it is that not having that element actually leads to suffering. 

Right concentration is being able to have focus at the right times so as not to cause suffering. 

In conclusion, seek to meditate on why not having an element of the eightfold path leads you to suffering and spend some time in contemplation why it is that not having right concentration actually leads one to suffering, because it will help you and others immensely when you are able to focus on the task at hand and help you to reduce the suffering that you have. Seek to journal (a means of contemplation) why it is that not having right concentration leads to suffering, I also have an article on this blog why its important that people take up jouranling as a means of spiritual devotion.

What needs to be understood is what not having right concentration leads to. It causes suffering in that the sense that you are not able to discipline yourself to focus/concentration on something which you want to. So you are not able to concentrate on something appropriately (i.e giving way to concentration at the correct times so as to not suffer) causing suffering to yourself as you seeks to grapple with an object of focus, but not being able to, thus this causes suffering to you in your life, so you essentially just goes from one object of focus to another with very little control and very little awareness from the person and this then causes suffering to the individual.

Therefore, the path of developing right concentration is to first recognize as and when you are not able to focus and this comes through things like meditation, mindfulness (so that you are more mindful as and when you are not giving way to the correct levels of concentration). But you should also seek out the cause as to why you are not able to concentrate on something.
