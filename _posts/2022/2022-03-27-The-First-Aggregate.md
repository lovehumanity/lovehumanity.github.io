In this short article I will talk a little bit about the first aggregate of the five aggregates in Buddhism. If you don’t know the Buddha taught that there is no self and that what you view as yourself just isn’t so and is in reality an illusion. I will talk a little bit about the first aggregate which is physical body. 

The first thing you need fully appreciate before understanding any of the five aggregates is that you need to link the idea of self to control, this took me a lot of contemplation and it will take others some thought/meditation to be able to make this connection because its not an easy connection to make. Ask yourself what qualities would you expect “self” to actually have? Spend some time in contemplation over this question and it will help you understand a little that the idea of self is heavily linked to the idea of control.

Furthermore, the physical body isn’t something which you can bend to your will. For example, you are not actually able to control how you look, the color of your eyes etc. Granted you can control how you look through things such as cosmetics, but this is only temporary. If body were self, then you would be able to control it at will. But like I said its important to first see the connection between control and self before you are able to understand why each of the 5 aggregates are not “self”.  

Therefore, its important to not identify with your physical form because you are not your physical form because you are not able to control your physical form completely, granted you can control it to some extend with cosmetics, but that isn’t full control. Therefore, its important to not identify with any body part because ultimately you are not able to control your physical form and bend it to your will and so therefore isn’t self.

Of course I am very new to Buddhism so take what I say with a pinch of salt and there are other resources listed below which may help you understand Buddhism a little better.
