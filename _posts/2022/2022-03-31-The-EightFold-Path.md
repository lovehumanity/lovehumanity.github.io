In this short article I will layout my understandings of the eightfold path, giving you some advice on how to come out of dukka or as is quite commonly referred to as suffering and how it will help lead you out of dukka which I will leave untranslated and it is roughly translated as unsatisfactory, suffering, pain, unhappiness.

The first and most important thing when attempting to understand any of the elements of the eightfold path is to first really understand why not having mastered one of the elements causes suffering. This is key in mastering any of the elements of the eightfold path because once you are able to recognise why not having mastered an element causes suffering it makes it much easier for you to be able to master that aspect.

Just a word on my understanding of what is meant by “right” – it means that you give way to an element of the eightfold path at the correct place and at the correct time so as to not cause dukka to yourself and so that you are free from dukka.

A basic example for me is that I would often engage in speech that was divisive at times and it took me some time to understand really that this causes suffering and understand why not having mastered right speech caused me dukka in my life. 

Mastering any of the eightfold path elements is not done in a day – it is only through careful contemplation that you are able to understand why not having mastered an element such as right mindfulness causes you dukka in your life.

But it’s a very big promise that you are able to end dukka (suffering) in your life and one day reach nirvana which is a state of unborn, unconditioned and is something which most practicing every day Buddhists strive for.
