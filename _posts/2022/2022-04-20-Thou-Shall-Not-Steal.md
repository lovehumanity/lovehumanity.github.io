I wanted to talk here about thou shall not steal which I think is something that if abided by will lead everyone that much closer towards God.

Thou shall not steal doesn’t just mean personal belongings. It also means ideas, behaviors, thought processes etc. and is something that I would like to see more and more people look towards. Thou shall not steal is also about yourself in terms of you are not being true and authentic towards yourself by stealing from other people. Its also sin in comparing yourself to an idol and stealing from other thoughts and then changing the way you are based on others’ opinions/ideas but not trusting yourself.

Its also sin if you allow others to constantly steal from you because of thou shall not kill. In my life I have mostly I think understood thou shall not steal, but I think everyone has their own levels of wrongness and nobody commits the same sin, and nobody follows by word the 10 commandments by heart because nobody on earth is perfect.

Therefore, my suggestion to all who read this article is to write by hand several times all 10 commandments (perhaps one at a time) and seek to understand how you yourself break the 10 commandments, because everyone in their own ways breaks the 10 commandments even myself because I am not perfect.

For example, write by hand on several pages thou shall not steal and seek to better understand how you yourself take from others. Then on several pages write thou shall not kill, then on several pages write thou shall not serve any other gods before me, then on several pages write thou shall not kill and seek to contemplate a lot more how you break the 10 commandments. 

As always, I do suggest that anyone on the spiritual path towards God take up meditation and prayer and service to others of some kind through a job of some sort.

Also seek to contemplate if you try to steal from other people's experiences and lead by way of example.
