In this article I will talk about the golden rule, which is a principal that all who follow the path of spirituality and freedom should adhere to as best as they can. The golden rule as set out by Jesus was that you should treat others how you yourself would like to be treated. In an ideal world people would be loving, kind, generous, peaceful etc. and so following the golden rule is really important in doing that.

In an ideal world people would be more respectful to one another and this can and only begins by you and your actions. Nobody can force you to follow the golden rule, its down to the individual to follow and adhere to this fundamental spiritual law in their lives and apply it to themselves daily and to follow it each time they meet and greet someone and each time they talk with someone.

Also, I take the principal of what would an ideal world look like? Would an ideal world look like people filled with jealousy, lust, envy, greed, negativity? Or would an ideal world be filled with loving, kind, generous, peaceful people with objects of beauty? I wager it’s the latter. Therefore, it’s very important to all who are on the spiritual path to follow the golden rule and apply to themselves each and every time they talk with someone.

In conclusion, the golden rule is something that all should follow and adhere to in their lives because it will make the world a much, much brighter and better place if there were more people who were loving, kind, generous, understanding, forgiving, compassionate, caring to one another, it would also bring Gods kingdom upon earth because God is a God of love and he loves each and every one of us individually even the most abject sinners in the world because we are his children and no matter what we do we will always be his children.
