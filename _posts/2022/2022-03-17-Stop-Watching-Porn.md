In this article I will talk a little about Porn. Now Porn is a topic which many people in our society don’t like to discuss, but hide, like its something that should be hidden to the general public, when generally a lot of people watch it and consume it on daily basis and I think it should be brought to the forefront because its extremely wrong the kinds of porn that the industry promotes and the effect that this has on young people to this day and the effect that it has had on people’s lives, especially young people.

The porn industry needs a major shift because the kinds of things that it promotes just isn’t righteous, things such as adultery which destroy families and ruin family life just isn’t right and the fact that mainstream porn industries promote this is very sinful in my eyes.

But the effect it had on young people including myself will last people a lifetime and has had a major impact on society in terms of people’s mental health, wellbeing and spiritual development and development as people.

It promotes these sinful scenarios and incest porn such as “step moms”, “step sisters”, “daughter swaps”, “step dads”, “step brothers” who have sex with each other and it effects people psychologically, mentally and emotionally and effects society as a whole. Of course, most of them are not actually real “step moms”, “step sisters”, “step dads” and “step brothers”, but it promotes to young people this kind of thing, which I think is a grievous sin towards God and his kingdom and something needs to change in the porn industry as a whole and in society. 

It promotes sin in terms of making young people lustful towards “porn actresses”, making them believe that things like adultery are normal in our society and of course they almost certainly are not. I guess because young people grow up in this environment where they watch these sinful acts which are promoted by the porn industry, and it encourages them to believe that this is completely acceptable and normal things like adultery and these really unusual and weird scenarios which just don’t happen in the real world with actual loving and caring couples who have lived together for decades who servants of God are.

I think the solution is to make people recognize, especially young people and the porn industry itself the wrongdoings that they do and the effect that it has in our society, especially to young people and young adults such as myself who has watched such sinful acts and videos for so long.

In conclusion, I think that the solution to any issue in society is to first raise awareness to the general public and the people actually effected by it especially on why its so wrong and evil. The porn industry as a whole needs major reform and laws and regulations need to be put in place which stop the promotion of such sinful acts such as adultery and the young people that consume this kinds of content need to stop watching this content, but of course this is very difficult to do when its so heavily pushed this kind of content onto young people, therefore only until Governments start to act in accordance with God and start to actually take action to help young people across the globe stop watching these kinds of sinful content online is when we can start to see a shift in the mental health and wellbeing of young people in our society and instead promote normal and happy loving and caring families in our society, because what the porn industry as a whole promotes is extremely wrong and sinful and goes against the ten commandments, thou shall not lie (lying about them being “step moms”), thou shall not kill (“killing family life, killing happily married couples, killing what could have been happily married, loving caring couples), thou shall not steal (“stealing what could have been loving and caring couples), thou shall not serve any other God before me (“Serving dubious masters who don’t have societies best interests), thou shall honor your father and mother (promoting discontent with mother and father, through incest porn) thou shall not commit adultery (incest porn), Thou shall not make idols (promoting through masturbation worship to these sinful people in the industry as a whole), thou shall not covet (promoting lust to people). So, in total 8 of the 10 commandments are broken and it’s a grievous sin to break that many of the ten commandment and goes very much against God and his wishes for humanity. Hence why it’s important that young people are brought awareness to this issue and why it’s important that adults who should know better than young people do more about this, because in my eyes its an abomination to the concept of God the whole industry in porn and the fact that Governments around the world are actually complacent in this, and only until we as individuals start to take to thing such as meditation, prayer and service to God can things begin to change in society as a whole and the porn industry can begin to change as a whole.
