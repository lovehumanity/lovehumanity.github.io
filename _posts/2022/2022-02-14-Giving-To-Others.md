You should first start by recognizing that it’s not all about you and allowing things like pride and arrogance (ego) have an impact on your ability to give. I myself have allowed pride to affect me a lot and its cost me a lot in life as it has others. 

Everyone has the ability to give and it’s important that others give because as the Master Jesus once said you ‘reap what you sow’, therefore what you put out to the world you will also get in return, but only if you believe that God will return what you give and you shouldn’t worry too much about when God will return what you give because so long as you have enough faith that God will give what you put out – he will.

Its important also to not have ill will when giving to others but have the real intention of helping them and doing it for them and not for yourself, and having trust that God will return to you in his own time whatever it is you give out to the world.

A basic example is when you pray for others with the intent of helping them, then God will see that and will return that and help you in some way. But it all comes down to right intention (working for the good of others) in Buddhism which is something I have struggled with a lot in my life. 

Giving is also about being fair to others whilst being fair to yourself. So seeing that giving away a book to a baby isn't very beneficial to the baby. Its about the value that the giving brings to the other person which is of importance and the benefit it brings to that person. 

Its also about the level of sacrafice that you give which is of importance. A basic example of this is you really value a possession of some kind and give that away then that confers greater blessings than giving away items that have no value to you. But you should also appreciate the value that items bring to others and appreciate the value that the items bring to yourself, a basic example for me is I use my PC for work and for me to give that away to a child who will never use it will be detrimental to both parties in the long run.

There was also a really good video on YouTube that said that giving to others will make you a lot happier and a lot more cheerful [Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78nsxRxbf4w)

This is information which I got from The Great White Brotherhood's book "Linking with the 4th dimension" Chapter 27 The Giving Plane, you can find a link to the book here [Linking with the 4th Dimension](https://thegreatwhitebrotherhood.org/books/) and I have found it to be true in my life.
