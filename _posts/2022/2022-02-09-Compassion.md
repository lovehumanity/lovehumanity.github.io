I thought I would write this article on compassion. This will be similar to my article I wrote on self-compassion, but it applies to giving others compassion and compassion is a very important thing to give to others because a lot of people have gone through suffering and its important to be understanding of that suffering and so give them the compassion that will heal them.

The first thing that you need to accept is that you need to have good intent when attempting to provide someone with compassion. If there isn’t good intent, then compassion will not be as effective. As with any other Christ like emotion.

I also just wanted to add what is meant by suffering and really, it’s just dissatisfaction in how your experience is right now and can take the form as it has with mine in terms of mental suffering, emotional suffering, you can suffer also from your false beliefs.

You first need to connect with the person and put efforts to understand and appreciate the suffering that they are going through. But see them on a deeper level and also respect them. I have struggled with giving compassion to others and still struggle because I feel I can be very ignorant and selfish sometimes because of my own self-importance, which I’ve struggled with a lot in my life and plan on posting my article on self-importance that I wrote very soon.

I feel that the key thing with compassion is empathy also with the person and putting efforts to see the suffering they are going through. But seeing the person behind the suffering and accepting them as they are and having a deep level of compassion for what they’ve been through and what they are going through right now.

But for me I’ve also realized that I just suffer for the sake of suffering and this is due to my delusion of how to end suffering I should suffer in the present to avoid further suffering in the future and I realized that following the noble four truths of Buddhism has helped me out of suffering and the eightfold path is the path out of suffering, which I recommend all who read this to take more seriously because it will end your suffering that you go through.

I also realized that I somewhat identified with my suffering and allowed it to control me and was foolishly somewhat proud of my suffering as I felt that suffering gives you strength, but not to the degree I have suffered and made others suffer as a result of my own suffering. 

But you shouldn’t just give compassion out blindly all the time because they may expect that compassion all the time and then they won’t learn from their mistakes of not understanding the nature of suffering and how the noble eightfold path is indeed the way out of suffering. Which is why I feel it’s important to teach to others why they suffer and it’s due to desire and attachment to things, because when you attach and desire and no longer have those things then you suffer.

Desire can be anything, you desire for the future to be a certain way, you desire for others to behave a certain way, you desire for the world to be a certain way, but the solution is to have no desire, because all suffering is caused by desire. It’s also about attachment because people attach themselves to items, luxury clothing, the past, the future, people, situations – I.e. they want a situation to go a certain way etc and so when these things are no longer with you – you suffer. The solution is to have no desire.

So instead of trying to change the world, seek to change yourself before you change others because you are not yet perfect and have a long journey ahead of you as do, we all. But just take the journey in strides and don’t try to rush it because of others, enjoy every moment of it.
