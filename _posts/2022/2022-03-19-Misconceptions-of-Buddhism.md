In this article I will talk a little bit about perceptions in Buddhism and how this has deterred people from actually following Buddhism.

Firstly, people generally tend to think as Buddhism as a religion – which I personally don’t think that it is because it doesn’t say if it does or does not believe in a God and which I think makes it more of a theology. But I guess to me Buddhism is more so a way of living that anything else.

The general opinion or first thing that comes to mind when people hear of Buddhism is monks, bald heads, sexual abstinence, life of monastery etc. This then in my eyes deters people from actually looking more into Buddhism and following Buddhism. Which I think is a real shame because it is very wise teachings from a master of this world.

Also, I think it’s ironic because the Buddha himself recognized the truth that you shouldn’t put labels on information, because it deters from the information itself. So, you should look at the information held on a topic, rather than giving way to your preconceived notions of what the information is. When applied to Buddhism or the perceptions of it, they actually deter people from looking more into the teachings.

Therefore, I think that we in society need to change our perceptions of Buddhism because Buddhism isn’t just about being a monk, shaving your hair off, sexual abstinence etc. Its so much more than that and it’s a real shame that so many people dismiss it out of hand due to their misconceptions of it.

Buddhism is believe it or not a promise that you can end your own suffering right here on earth and for me this has proven true because the four noble truths if understood correctly will indeed end your own suffering and you will reach nirvana if you follow the noble four truths correctly which is a state of bliss, enlightenment, unborn – its difficult for me to put into words what it actually really is, but I recommend that you read more on what nirvana really is to understand it better.
