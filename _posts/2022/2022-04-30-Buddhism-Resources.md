In this very short article, I will lay out some of the resources which I have used in the past which has helped me considerably with understanding Buddhism a lot more and I also realize am new to Buddhism.

“Buddhism plain and simple” by Steve Hagen is a book I recommend to those aspiring to become Buddhist and seeking to free themselves from suffering or dukka as its called in Buddhism. It explains the basics and the four noble truths in good details and easy enough for beginners and so recommend this book to all looking to understand Buddhism.

<https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/index.html> This website has helped me tremendously with understanding the eightfold path a lot more, namely right speech which is something which I really suffered with for some time and so recommend this website and its articles to all who are following the path towards inner enlightenment. 

The last book I recommend is a book which helps a lot with understanding the five hindrances in Buddhism “Unhindered: A Mindful Path Through the Five Hindrances” by Gil Fronsdal. This book is a book I recommend to all who have mastered the four noble truths and are now in the process of dealing with the 5 hindrances which are hindrances to nirvana. This book lays out very clearly in plain English how to overcome the hindrances and gives good practical guidance on overcoming them in your life.

I also just wanted to add that it takes a long time in meditation and through contemplation to master the noble four truths and reach nirvana. It isn’t done in a single day and takes a lot of devotion to the path. I recommend to all that you spend a lot of time in meditation and contemplation seeking to understand the noble four truths and time seeking to overcome the five hindrances. 

I assure you that the rewards are very big for reaching nirvana and freeing yourself or dukka.

Of course, these books are just my suggestions and the books that have helped me on the path. You can use the website that I listed here instead if you would rather not spend the money. There are plenty of free resources available online to help understand Buddhism a lot more and these two books I suggest here are just the books that have helped me and may or may not help you.

You can also check out my articles on the four noble truths on this blog which may help you along the path and they are all free. 

I will also be doing articles on all of the eightfold path so be sure to check out those articles.
