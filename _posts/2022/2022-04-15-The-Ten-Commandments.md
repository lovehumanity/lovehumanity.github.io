I wanted to write this short piece on the ten commandments, which if adhered to and really understood are enough to carry you into the arms of God. If you don’t know the ten commandments are “you shall have no other Gods before me”, “you shall not make for yourself an idol”, “you shall not take the name of God in vain”, “Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy”, “honor your father and mother”, “you shall not kill”, “you shall not commit adultery”, “you shall not steal”, “you shall not lie”, “you shall not covet” (yearn to possess something).

The issue that a lot of people seem to not quite understand with the ten commandments I believe are that people often take the ten commandments are literally, for example thou shall not steal, often people interpret it as meaning you shouldn’t take others personal items for yourself. But yet how often do we steal from people’s ideas? How often do we join a conversation to steal from other people’s good energy that they produce? 

Therefore, when adhering to the ten commandments, seek to really meditate and spend some time understanding each of them and their implications and how to apply them into your life. With thou shall not make for yourself an idol, how often do we as a society try to idealize body images for men and women? How often do we look up at those who are more famous and wealthier than us? How often do we idealize being a so called “good person”? These are just some of my own interpretations of thou shall not make for yourself an idol and with each of the ten commandments time should be spend in meditation or through journaling of some kind where notes made of how you yourself break one of the ten commandments.

Another example is thou shall not commit adultery, how often do we when in a loving relationship commit sin in having sex with others through dream sleep? Yes, they are dreams, but that doesn’t excuse the fact and implies that you are not content with your current relationship. How often do we look at other people or flirt with others when already in a loving relationship? How often we turn our heads when an attractive person walks past when already in a loving relationship? These are just some examples and are food for thought.

In conclusion, I don’t want to give too many of my own interpretations regarding the ten commandments because it takes away from your own interpretations and really my points are just suggestions in how you may interpret the ten commandments. With each of the ten commandments really try to understand each of them and look for the implications in them, seek to meditate and start a journal to help to understand yourself better and understand how it is you break some of the 10 commandments. We are all far from perfect and as such it is bound that in our lives, we break the ten commandments somehow because if we were able to apply each of the ten commandments to our lives, we would be at Gods side already. But we are all far from perfect on earth and even the great masters such as Buddha, Jesus, Moses etc were not perfect. We each have a long journey ahead of us and its important to keep up our strength in the coming years.

I also recommend to all that they recite the 10 commandments by hand and do lines on them and put efforts to contemplate in which ways they break the 10 commandments.
