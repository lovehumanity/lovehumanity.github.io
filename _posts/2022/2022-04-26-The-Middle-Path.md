In this article I will talk a little bit about the middle path. To understand what the middle path is you first need to understand what the right-hand path and left-hand path are. The left-hand path is essentially that you promote individualism and do things for yourself generally at the cost of others, the right-hand path is that you help people and promotes selflessness in a sense. While the middle path recognizes that its about life in the sense that the right-hand path essentially goes against the left-hand path and the right-hand path essentially goes against those on the left-hand path. 

The Middle-Path recognizes that all is one and everyone has a right to be on the left-hand path or the right-hand path and doesn’t discriminate between either of them. But those on the middle-path are essentially able to bestow blessings on anyone who is on the right-hand path or the left-hand path.

But it also comes in realizing that you can’t just do things for yourself and be individualist (left-hand path) and it also comes in the sense that you can’t just do things by helping others (right hand path). In a sense the middle path is strikes a balance between the right-hand path and those on the left-hand path and this myself I can see that there is truth in the middle path because if you only help people, then they don’t learn for themselves, while if you are just so individualistic you see that you put yourself down in the sense of you don’t really care for others and live a very lonely life away from others.

But the key thing which I see is that those on the left-hand path and the right-hand path generally discriminate against one another and this is wrong because all is one as everyone has the right to choose whichever path they desire and those on the middle path recognise this.

Its also about helping people, because those on the middle path recognise that to only help people isn’t really in line with the reality of the world in the sense that there are people on the left-hand path. The key thing with the middle path is that it strikes a balance between the right-hand path and the left-hand path and allows you to help those on both the left-hand path and the right-hand path. Which gives a lot of freedom to yourself and to others.
