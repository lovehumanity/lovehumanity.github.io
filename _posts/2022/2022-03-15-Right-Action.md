In this short article I will be talking about Right action. Right action is the 3rd element of the eightfold path and is a very important aspect of it. Right action first begins by understanding why exactly your actions lead to suffering. This is key to actually being able to incorporate right action as part of yourself.

I will also just mean a little by what I mean by “right”. Right to me means have the correct level of something at the right moment in time and in the right circumstances which doesn’t bring suffering to you. 

Right action like I said first begins by understanding why your actions actually bring about suffering and right action is linked heavily to right speech because with right action – in my view right speech follows. Right mindfulness also helps significantly with having right action because with right mindfulness comes the ability to recognize more of your actions because you are much more mindful.

Also, as a note you don’t need to in my view work on one aspect of the eightfold path and another – you can have right mindfulness and then right understanding, they don’t need to be followed in order and in my view is better that there are not followed in order.

In conclusion, you should seek to perhaps work on right mindfulness first because it helps to bring about right action. The key thing with all the eightfold paths is to recognize why not having one element brings suffering to you and this only comes from contemplation and meditation. Perhaps seek to journal and maybe you will be able to recognise how your own ways are hindering you from being able to practice right action. But in my view having right action is a lot easier when you have right mindfulness.
