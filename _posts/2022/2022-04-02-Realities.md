In this short article I will be talking a little bit about illusions. The vast majority of the public are under some kind of illusion, it’s only those extremely enlightened that you could argue are not under a very big illusion. We all live in an illusion but its really just a question of to what extend are you under an illusion? The vast majority of the public are still under the control of their mind and have little freedom in my eyes compared to more enlightened people.

Some people do not live in a deeper reality because it is detrimental to them and their wellbeing and so to live in an illusion is needed until the person is able to reach a deeper reality. My analogy for reality is a Matryoshka doll whereby you have a deeper reality each time you lift up the doll, but its important to realize that people need illusions or some level of illusions to be able to function effectively in society.

Everyone has their own reality in this world, but you shouldn’t try to make people conform to your reality. This can be done by ensuring that you go by society’s expectations of what it means to be normal and is something that I haven’t really given way to in the past because I just wanted to be special and, in my eyes, I think that everyone in their own way strives to be special.

You should also realize that reality is made up of a few things your beliefs, thoughts and imagination and each one person has their own reality to which they confirm to, so its best to if you have obtained some freedom through things such as meditation and prayer, then its best to not boast about it to others because it threatens people’s reality to which they conform to and a lot of people will look in horror and what freedom actually is because they are so used to living in their own reality and it harms their sense of the world and is detrimental to the person as well mentally, emotionally and spirituality. In my eyes its better to tell a white lie than to threaten another person’s reality because it would be a greater sin in the sense that thou shall not kill is going to cause more upset to the person that thou shall not lie.

Hence why it’s important with all endeavors of spirituality to go at your own pace and to not give away the fact that you are a very free soul compared to others or go announcing it to the world that you are becoming a very free soul because it is detrimental to you and detrimental to others and detrimental to Gods kingdom in the sense that you harm others (Gods creation) and harm yourself (Gods creation).
