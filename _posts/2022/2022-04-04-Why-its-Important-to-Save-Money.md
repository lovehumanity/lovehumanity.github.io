In this article I will be talking about why it’s so important that you save money. This isn’t really my usual article, but I thought that this subject was important enough to share with the world because I feel that in modern society, we are so consumeristic what with being bombarded with advertisements on places like the television, the internet etc.

The first thing that is important when saving money is to look at your spending and be conservative with how much you are spending. Do you really need Disney+, Netflix, Amazon Prime and HBO Plus? When you are not watching anything on Amazon Prime? My advice is to review all your spending and things coming out of your account and seek to look at the spending that you are able to reduce.

The second thing to realize when seeking to save money is to ensure that you have an emergency fund in your bank of say £750 for emergency funds such as an emergency dental appointment, an emergency with a car repair etc. With having a reserve £750 in your bank then it will help to ensure that you don’t go into any overdraft with your bank and ensure that you are as debt free as possible. Of course, it doesn’t have to be £750, but needs to be a reasonable amount of money compared to your monthly income.

It’s also important to not put all your eggs in one basket so to speak and put all your life savings into investments, you should seek to ensure that you keep some of your life savings in a bank account or a savings account, but it’s important to strike a balance between savings in savings accounts and savings in investments. You shouldn’t put too much of your money into investments.

Its also about yourself, because with saving money it will allow you to have those things in your life that you need, but don’t have such as a nice holiday and this motivates you to keep saving. It also allows you to help others by being able to give money to others who are more in need than you are, but just ensure that you don’t be greedy with money because its very easy to fall into this as I have in my life, because with greed you don’t appreciate the amount that you have and own, and so it takes away the value of the amount of money you really have.

In conclusion, seek to ensure that you keep a reasonable amount of money in your bank as an emergency fund and seek to ensure that you review your spending at the start of each month so that you can reduce your spending. This in turn will offer you more freedom in your life to use your hard-earned money as and when you choose and be more selective as to which businesses you support. Also, its about being kind to yourself, its your money that you earned and you shouldn’t be spending it on things which you don’t use or receive any value from.
