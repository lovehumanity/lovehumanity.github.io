I"9<p>This post will look at some reasons why you should create a blog.</p>

<p>If you don’t know what a blog is, it is quite simply a platform on which you discuss topics of your choosing. What you choose to post is entirely up to you, you can choose to disassociate from your real identity with your blog identity, so that for example an employer is not able to easily find your blog, and also so that viewers of your blog can not easily find out information about you.</p>

<h4 id="reason-1">Reason 1</h4>

<p>You are free to express your own opinions and own ideas on topics that you choose. This is pretty awesome because you have more freedom to present your ideas in a clear fashion. You also have complete control on what you do and don’t talk about, meaning you can freely talk about things that spark your curiosity, and equally not talk about things that you find boring.</p>

<h4 id="reason-2">Reason 2</h4>

<p>Just one of your blog posts could benefit other peoples lives in a positive way, which helps to create positive change in the world. This reason alone should be enough to encourage others to start a blog. When I hear the argument of people saying that they don’t have anything to offer the world, I tell them that the number 1 most valuable thing they have to offer the world is themselves. Everyone has opinions and ideas on things, why not take it a step further and share those to the world?</p>

<h4 id="reason-3">Reason 3</h4>

<p>Maintaining a blog encourages you to be more productive because you want to actually post something of value to others and in turn you spend less time mindlessly consuming content. This I can vouch for, because it encourages you to spend less time consuming others content, and focus on creating your own content. I can’t tell you how much time I personally have spent consuming other people’s content, and there is a lot of content out there, but I look at it in terms of value for time. There is a point at which you consume so much content that the value of the content you consume starts dropping and so you find yourself consuming very low quality content so the value for time goes down the more you consume. Creating a blog encourages you to produce more which means you spend less time consuming.</p>

<h4 id="reason-4">Reason 4</h4>

<p>You are your own censor and if you host your own blog then you have little to fear of it being taken down. Freedom of speech is mostly dead, what with the tech giants taking it upon themselves to censor a lot of information they deem to be false. By creating a blog you are not subject to any of the tech giants totalitarian rules of censorship, because you are publishing your ideas on your own blog.</p>

<h4 id="reason-5">Reason 5</h4>

<p>You are taking away the power of tech giants by posting your ideas on a blog and not on somewhere say Facebook or Twitter. This reason is good because by creating a blog you are helping to decentralize the power in the world, because the modern tech giants have become a centralized platform by which people share ideas, and because they are centralized those tech giants have a complete monopoly over the ideas they want to push forward to the world. So by decentralizing your ideas by writing a blog you are helping to create a more open, free, and trustworthy world free from the control of the power of centralized tech giants.</p>

<h4 id="reason-6">Reason 6</h4>

<p>Creating a blog can be an effective way to make money. You could generate revenue on your blog by agreeing to a sponsor from a company, you could place a donation link to encourage your viewers to donate to you. You could also decide to place ads on your blog, however I am against ads as they currently are and will soon right a blog post on my thoughts on it, so stay tuned for that.</p>

<h4 id="reason-7">Reason 7</h4>

<p>You help to encourage others to start their own blog which could benefit them in a positive way, which in turn could help to benefit others in a positive way, and so creates a sort of chain reaction.</p>

<h4 id="reason-8">Reason 8</h4>

<p>You are likely going to come into contact with like minded individuals because these will likely be the people that read your blog, and because they read your blog you are likely to share the same values and beliefs. Therefore starting a blog may be an opportunity to make new friends.</p>

<h4 id="reason-9">Reason 9</h4>

<p>When hosting a blog you have the power to customise it the way you want. Don’t like the panel in that position? Just change it. Don’t like the colour scheme of your blog? Just change it. You now have the power to take from all those amazing website designs you have seen and mesh it into your own kind of website design that you like.</p>

<h4 id="reason-10">Reason 10</h4>

<p>Blogging is an amazing learning experience for you in your journey in life if you do so choose to take it up. It teaches you how to correctly articulate your ideas, how to correctly engage with your readers, how to grow something small into something that is big, how to create something that you can call yours.</p>

<p>In conclusion there are many reasons why you should create a blog, my favorite being that you help to benefit others in a positive way. People should try to see the bigger picture and try to see beyond what it is in it for them. As Gandhi says “You must be the change you want to see in the world”</p>
