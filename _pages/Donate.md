I don't like asking for donations, but I am in need of money and all money donated goes into supporting me in my life.

But if any of you would like to donate please **ONLY GIVE WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD**. 

I am just one person, by no means does donating offer any extra spiritual teachings.

Any issues with your donations and please do send an email to my email chrisisamazing@protonmail.com

Please do not donate me large sums of money.

My Patreon link is down below:
