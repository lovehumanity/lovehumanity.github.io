I believe in freedom of information, but if you feel like donating to me feel free. 

I speak from experience in my articles and so they are not your typical articles you find on popular search engines. 

Please only give what you can absolutely afford. 

If you require a refund for any reason at all for your donation then please do email me at chrisisamazing@protonmail.com and I will get back to you as soon as possible via email.

All donations will first and foremost be going into supporting this blog. So I advertise this blog on both Google and Bing and so any money will help go towards advertising this blog even more, it also supports me financially in my life and pays me for the time that I've put into this blog because I have spent a considerable amount of time working on this blog and the articles are high value and from my own personal experiences in life. But also please only give what you can absolutely afford.

Below is the buymeacoffee link for my blog.
