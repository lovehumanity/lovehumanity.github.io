![Me]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/charity.jpg)

I believe in freedom of information, but if you feel like donating to me feel free. 

I speak from experience in my articles and so they are not your typical articles you find on popular search engines. 

Please only give what you can absolutely afford. 

If you require a refund for any reason at all for your donation then please do email me at chrisisamazing@protonmail.com and I will get back to you as soon as possible via email.

All donations will first and foremost be going into supporting this blog. So I advertise this blog on both Google and Bing and so any money will help go towards advertising this blog even more, it also supports me financially in my life and pays me for the time that I've put into this blog because I have spent a considerable amount of time working on this blog and the articles are high value and from my own personal experiences in life. But also please only give what you can absolutely afford.

I did have a buymeacoffee link, however this didn't work when a relative tried to donate to it so I have replaced it with a patreon link.

Below is my Patreon page. You will however need to create an account to be able to donate to me. 

Please whatever you do, DO NOT DONATE ME LARGE SUMS OF MONEY, I only need enough to sustain this blog's advertisement which is around Â£5,000 a month as of the end of last month and I will release the numbers on the total amount I spend on ads each month at the end of each month, I currently advertise on Twitter, Facebook, Google, Reddit and any extra I intend on donating to noble causes.
