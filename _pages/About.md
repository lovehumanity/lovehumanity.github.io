Welcome to my small blog on the internet. I live in the UK. I maintain this blog here partly for my own personal development and spiritual journey and also to help others along the way. If you disagree with any of the articles or want to get in touch feel free to send me an email with your thoughts chrisisamazing@protonmail.com .This blog is hosted completely free using jeykll minimal mistakes theme and gitlab. 

In this Blog You'll find articles on the following topics:

- Wellbeing   
- Spirituality 
- Self-Improvement
- Buddhism
- Anything else I deem important enough to share with the world

Also a side note that the articles on this blog are not very long in length because I like to keep it quick and to the point and avoid 'filler' as much as possible, which is what I see a lot of articles I read do. Also wanted to add that just because an article is old - that doesn't mean that its of less value, I update each article and each article will stand the test of time. 

## The Great White Brotherhood

I work with a group of humans that live in the heavenly spheres that call themselves The Great White Brotherhood. Great implying nobility, White implying purity of intentions and Brotherhood meaning a collective. Most people generally mistake this group for being a white supremacy group due to the name but having followed their teachings for a number of years I can attest to their authenticity and they are serious in their intention of spreading various spiritual teachings to the world and spreading the truths of the world. 

Here are their websites and the YouTube Channel of Bob Sanders who channels their messages and works for them.

## Awesome Subjects :mag:

- Buddhism _(Desire is the cause of suffering)_   
- Psychology _(Teleology - All human behaviour stems from a goal) _ 
- Spirituality _(I can be better, therefore I will strive to be)_  
- Economics _(The fed be printing money for days!)_  
- Taoism _("When you identify a flaw as a flaw, you no longer be with that flaw")_

I find that all subjects are linked together. Really it comes down to how you define the information in a subject. For example, Buddhism a religion or philosophy whichever way you wish to view it links strongly with Psychology. Then that links with economics because of how people trade etc, etc. Point being is that all subjects are intertwined in some way.

## How this blog is hosted Completely Free :heavy_dollar_sign:

This blog is hosted using gitlab pages and Jekyll using the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/) which allows me to host this blog completely free. I chose gitlab to host this blog because gitlab is [more open source](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab) than github which is completely [closed sourced](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24254324/is-github-com-source-code-open-source). Personally I find it quite ironic that a website that hosts so much open source code isn't itself open source, it's a bit like writing a book on the importance of giving to others, and yet turning a profit for said book.
