## About this Blog

Welcome to my blog on the internet. I live in the UK. I maintain this blog here for my own personal development and spiritual journey and also to help others along the way. If you disagree with any of the articles or want to get in touch feel free to send me an email with your thoughts chrisisamazing@protonmail.com .This blog is hosted completely free using jeykll minimal mistakes theme and github/gitlab. 

In this Blog You'll find articles on the following topics:

- Wellbeing   
- Spirituality 
- Self-Improvement
- Buddhism
- Anything else I deem important enough to share with the world

This blog is hosted on both gitlab and github as of 28/02/2022! The links are:

Also a side note that the articles on this blog are not very long in length because I like to keep it quick and to the point and avoid 'filler' as much as possible, which is what I see a lot of articles I read do. Also wanted to add that just because an article is old - that doesn't mean that its of less value, I update each article and each article will stand the test of time. 

The further reading in my articles are just some websites that I come across when searching for the topic and I hope that they will improve my SEO (times I appear in search results) because generally I put alot of effort into this blog and for it to be unnoticed by others because I don't put further reading would be a crime to myself and others. So please don't feel the need to read everything in Further Reading, but only read that which you feel drawn to and just be true to yourself is my advice.

As a side note I do update this blog fairly regularly and so if you enjoy this content and would like to continue to come back here please do consider bookmarking this blog in your browser or saving the link. Or you have the option to subscribe with RSS if you still use that. 

## The Great White Brotherhood

I work with a group of humans that live in the heavenly spheres that call themselves The Great White Brotherhood. Great implying nobility, White implying purity of intentions and Brotherhood meaning a collective. Most people generally mistake this group for being a white supremacy group due to the name but having followed their teachings for a number of years I can attest to their authenticity and they are serious in their intention of spreading various spiritual teachings to the world and spreading the truths of the world. 

Here are their websites and the YouTube Channel of Bob Sanders who channels their messages and works for them.

## Awesome Subjects :mag:

- Buddhism _(Desire is the cause of suffering)_   
- Psychology _(Teleology - All human behaviour stems from a goal) _ 
- Spirituality _(I can be better, therefore I will strive to be)_  
- Economics _(The fed be printing money for days!)_  
- Taoism _("When you identify a flaw as a flaw, you no longer be with that flaw")_

I find that all subjects are linked together. Really it comes down to how you define the information in a subject. For example, Buddhism a religion or philosophy whichever way you wish to view it links strongly with Psychology. Then that links with economics because of how people trade etc, etc. Point being is that all subjects are intertwined in some way.

## How this blog is hosted Completely Free :heavy_dollar_sign:

This blog is hosted using gitlab pages and Jekyll using the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/) which allows me to host this blog completely free. I chose gitlab to host this blog because gitlab is [more open source](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab) than github which is completely [closed sourced](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24254324/is-github-com-source-code-open-source). Personally I find it quite ironic that a website that hosts so much open source code isn't itself open source, it's a bit like writing a book on the importance of giving to others, and yet turning a profit for said book.
