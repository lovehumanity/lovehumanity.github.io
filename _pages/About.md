## About Me

Firstly, yes I am actually the real Saint Christopher believe it or not.

Generally I don't like talking about myself because I was into privacy a lot in my late teens and young adult years even sharing photos of myself was a big jump for me on this blog, but my general interests right now are computers. I want to learn more about reverse engineering computer software and I'm currently employed in a service desk role in an IT company and hoping to learn alot more about reverse engineering in my free time and am thinking about pursuing this as a full time job or programming for that mattar, something in IT really. I used to be really into ethical hacking and enjoyed the show Mr Robot which really inspired me to become an ethical hacker and did the OSCP, but that took a lot out of me and isn't an easy certification.

I am 21 years old and was born on 08/08/2000 and have lived in London my entire life having grown up in a loving and caring family - I wasn't rich, but me and my family have got by over the years.

I have taken up art a little lately and enjoy drawing occasionally, but I'm not very good at art so don't enjoy sharing my artwork with others or the public that much. I enjoy spending time with my family, but hoping to soon start a family of my own one day.

In school I was really into History, Business Studies, Maths, Computers, Chess, Programming, Sociology, English, Debate club. I was an introvert in school so didn't really go out too much during my school years or my uni years for that mattar because I guess I was so afaid of what others would think of me and now I would like to make up for that lost time somewhat and be a lot more sociable which I am slowly but surely becoming.

I've been a really good judge of character my entire life and am a 'face person' and so when I see someone's face I can kind of tell if they are a good or bad person and so this has saved me alot of potential suffering and betrayal in my life, which has been an immense blessing to me.

I enjoy going for walks with my Dad and my Dog Lola. I used to play on my Ukulele which I was inspired by from a girl on the ward I was at when I was young and can play a few songs on there.

I have suffered from mental health in my life and to those who do suffer from mental health or think they suffer from mental heatlh, don't be afraid to ask for help, there is no shame in it and you are not a lesser man for asking for help because in our society we have this terrible view on what a man should and shouldn't be and this has evolved into toxic masculinity - which are things which are detrimental to us which we think is being a man when it isn't.

## About this Blog

This is my blog which I used as a tool for my personal development and my own spiritual journey and to help others along the way in their journeys.. I live in the UK currently with my parents and am planning on moving out very soon. If you disagree with any of the articles or want to get in touch feel free to send me an email with your thoughts chrisisamazing@protonmail.com .This blog is hosted completely free using jeykll minimal mistakes theme and github/gitlab and I encourage all who read this blog to start their own for their own spiritual journey and their own development. 

In this Blog You'll find articles on the following topics:

- Wellbeing   
- Spirituality 
- Self-Improvement
- Buddhism
- Anything else I deem important enough to share with the world

This blog is hosted on both gitlab and github as of 28/02/2022! The links are:

Also a side note that the articles on this blog are not very long in length because I like to keep it quick and to the point and avoid 'filler' as much as possible, which is what I see a lot of articles I read do. Also wanted to add that just because an article is old - that doesn't mean that its of less value, I update each article and each article will stand the test of time. 

The further reading in my articles are just some websites that I come across when searching for the topic and I hope that they will improve my SEO (times I appear in search results) because generally I put alot of effort into this blog and for it to be unnoticed by others because I don't put further reading would be a crime to myself and others. So please don't feel the need to read everything in Further Reading, but only read that which you feel drawn to and just be true to yourself is my advice.

As a side note I do update this blog fairly regularly and so if you enjoy this content and would like to continue to come back here please do consider bookmarking this blog in your browser or saving the link. Or you have the option to subscribe with RSS if you still use that and you will find an icon for that at the bottom of the page. 

## Awesome Subjects :mag:

- Buddhism _(Desire is the cause of suffering)_   
- Psychology _(Teleology - All human behaviour stems from a goal) _ 
- Spirituality _(I can be better, therefore I will strive to be)_  
- Economics _(The fed be printing money for days!)_  
- Taoism _("When you identify a flaw as a flaw, you no longer be with that flaw")_
- Computer Security _(The Hackers man! The hackers!)_

I find that all subjects are linked together. Really it comes down to how you define the information in a subject. For example, Buddhism a religion or philosophy whichever way you wish to view it links strongly with Psychology. Then that links with economics because of how people trade etc, etc. Point being is that all subjects are intertwined in some way.

## The Great White Brotherhood

I work with a group of humans that live in the heavenly spheres that call themselves The Great White Brotherhood. Great implying nobility, White implying purity of intentions and Brotherhood meaning a collective. They are **NOT** a white supremacy group. Most people generally mistake this group for being a white supremacy group due to the name but having followed their teachings for over 4 years I can attest to their authenticity and they are serious in their intention of spreading various spiritual teachings to the world and spreading the truths of the world. 

But generally you need an open mind to accept the information from this group because its just so different to what society has taught us. But if you dismiss this group as frauds I understand - for new information to be accepted you need pigeon holes to store information into and if you don't then its only natural for you to dismiss the information as just false. Therefore look into this group at your own discretion, because your friends/family will likely not like you for sharing this certain group, so tread carefully and remember to practice spirituality in secret - which I have an article on this blog about if you want to learn more about why you should do so in secret. 

I recommend reading their first book the Stairway to Freedom because this is a book which has helped me considerably in my journey and a book which I hope will bring benefit to you in your journey.

Here are their websites and the YouTube Channel of Bob Sanders who channels their messages and works for them.

## How this blog is hosted Completely Free :heavy_dollar_sign:

This blog is hosted using gitlab pages and Jekyll using the [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/) which allows me to host this blog completely free. I chose gitlab to host this blog because gitlab is [more open source](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab) than github which is completely [closed sourced](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24254324/is-github-com-source-code-open-source). Personally I find it quite ironic that a website that hosts so much open source code isn't itself open source, it's a bit like writing a book on the importance of giving to others, and yet turning a profit for said book. 

Refer to my article on how to setup a blog like this yourself for free using Linux linked [here](https://lovehumanity.gitlab.io/productivity/Creating-a-blog-for-free/)
