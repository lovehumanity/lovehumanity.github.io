Firstly they are **NOT** a white supremacy group. I repeat **NOT** a white supremacy group.

The Great White Brotherhood are a group of humans who once had an earthly incarnation and live in the heavenly spheres who work endlessly to assist mankind incarnate to unlock the mysteries of life.

I work with them and they have worked with me in my life and they spread spiritual wisdoms to the world through their website and through Bob Sanders Youtube Channel.

I heard of their teachings back in 2017 when I was into astral projection (which is really dangerous and shouldn't be done without training)

They have taught me a lot in my life and can confirm that their information comes from a higher source.

However, their information is very advanced and so it is very far out to anything that most, general everyday people can actually be able to understand and comprehend. Therefore, read their books if you will at your own pace and I recommend first reading "The Stariway to Freedom" which has helped me a great deal in my journey in incarnation and I recommend that you the public read it at your own pace and in your own time because generally you need pigeon holes or as I describe an open mind to be able to accept the information from this group, so if you are not able to accept any of the information - don't worry, you are just not ready for it yet.

Their website is:

Please don't send this group any hate messages. They stand for peace and love like how Jesus once did.
